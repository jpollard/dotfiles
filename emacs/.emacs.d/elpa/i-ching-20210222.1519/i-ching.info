     The (first) appearance of anything (as a bud) is what we call a

2 Casting a hexagram
********************

There are several ways to produce a hexagram, from the traditional to
pragmatic.

   Casting coins has been used for centuries as a way of consulting the
I Ching and often favoured for it’s simplicity and ease. In contrast,
the yarrow stalk method is widely considered more traditional,
requiring dedication, time and careful elaboration of process. The
coins may produce a result more quickly and directly (yang) while the
yarrow stalks yield to time and can create contemplative focus (yin).

   Quickest of all (thus far) is the general purpose computer, which
can produce a hexagram seemingly instantaneously.

   A simulation of yarrow stalks to produce a hexagram…
     (i-ching-cast 'yarrow-stalks)

   To simulate three coins…
     (i-ching-cast '3-coins)

   For the ultimate in computational pragmatism, you can produce a
hexagram from a single 6-bit number.
     (i-ching-cast '6-bit)

   The preferred method can be set or customized via the variable
`i-ching-divination-method'

   There are other significant methods which have not (yet) been
implemented, in particular the “Ancient
(https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/I_Ching/The_Ancient_Yarrow_Stalk_Method)“
(Neo-Confucian reconstruction) and “Modified
(https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/I_Ching/The_Modified_Yarrow_Stalk_Method)”
methods of casting yarrow stalks described by Huang and some of the
more idiosyncratic variants that have appeared during the 20th Century
CE.

   It is also possible to show the interpretation (i.e. description,
judgement and image) of a particular hexagram…

3 Consulting the oracle
***********************

     Of course all divination is vain, nor is the method of the Yî
     less absurd than any other.

     — James Legge in The I Ching. Sacred Books of the East, vol. 16
     (1899)


   Consulting the I Ching as an oracle, in it’s most simple form,
involves asking a question, casting a hexagram and interpreting the
hexagram along with any possible changes to the hexagram.

   You can query the I Ching with an invocation of `M-x i-ching-query'

   Or programmatically using any of the casting methods described
previously.
     (i-ching-query 'yarrow-stalks)

4 Printing & displaying hexagrams
*********************************

You can cast and insert a hexagram at the current point with
`i-ching-insert-hexagram' or insert a specific hexagram as required
with `(i-ching-insert-hexagram 23)'

   Sometimes the hexagrams may not display correctly or be too small to
read. The font and size can be adjusted as needed with minimal
interference to how other characters are displayed….

     (setq i-ching-hexagram-size 18
           i-ching-hexagram-font "DejaVu Sans")

   If the glyphs don’t appear to change you may need to call
`(i-ching-update-fontsize)'

5 changing or moving lines
**************************

The `3-coins' and `yarrow-stalk' methods calculate values for the lines
of the hexagram (6 or 9) and changing lines (7 or 8) as described in
the text and commentaries. These values are represented internally as
binary pairs which are used to produce a single hexagram, or a hexagram
and changing hexagram. The current package does not provide commentary
for individual lines or changing lines, preferring the concise
description of a hexagram (and potentially the changing hexagram).

   If a casting produces changing lines, the resulting hexagrams will
appear as `䷂→䷇' or `䷥ (䷢)' when displayed.

6 probabilities & randomness
****************************

The `3-coins' and `yarrow-stalk' methods produce slightly different
probability distributions for casting a hexagram as detailed in the
following table (and discussed in more detail in Probability and the Yi
Jing (https://sabazius.oto-usa.org/probability-and-the-yi-jing/))

Value   Yarrow stalks p(S)   Three coins p(S)    Yin/Yang     Signification          Line
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
6       1/16                 2/16                old yin      yin changing to yang   --x--
7       5/16  (yang 8/16)    6/16  (yang 8/16)   young yang   yang unchanging        -------
8       7/16   (yin 8/16)    6/16   (yin 8/16)   young yin    yin unchanging         -- --
9       3/16                 2/16                old yang     yang changing to yin   --o--

   In consulting an oracle the nature and source of chance,
synchronicity or randomness can be considered important aspects of the
process. Thus, this package can draw upon several source of randomness
including `quantum' (sampling quantum fluctuations of the vacuum via
ANU (https://qrng.anu.edu.au/)), `atmospheric' (atmospheric noise via
random.org (https://random.org)), or `pseudo' (pseudo-random numbers
provided by the local computing environment). Each method may be
assessed for its suitability and set as necessary.

     (setq i-ching-randomness-source 'quantum)

   The `quantum' and `atmospheric' sources of randomness both use
public APIs and can make hundred of calls (specifically 121, 125, 129
or 133 for the `yarrow-stalk' method) which can take seconds, or
minutes depending on the service which may be rate limited. This can be
used as a time for reflection. If you prefer to have a quicker casting,
you can register an API key or use the local `pseudo' random source.

   Further details and analysis of the sources of randomness can be
found in or near…

**********************

The translation from Chinese into English by James Legge, _The Yî
King_ (1882) as published in _Sacred Books of the East, vol. XVI. 2nd
edition_ (1899) is in the public domain and available via archive.org
(https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksofchi16conf). It appears to be
the only significant English translation that is currently in the
public domain. There is a parallel Chinese/English edition 《易經 -
Yi Jing》 (https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/yi-jing) hosted at the
Chinese Text Project (https://ctext.org) using the Legge translation.

   The German translation and commentary by Richard Wilhelm, _I Ging
Das Buch der Wandlungen_ (1924) is in the public domain and available
via Projekt Gutenberg
(https://www.projekt-gutenberg.org/autoren/namen/wilhelm.html).
Wilhelm’s translation from Chinese into German was translated into
English as _The I Ching or Book of Changes_ (1950) by Cary Baynes and
should enter the public domain in 2047. Wilhelm’s translation has
provided the basis for translation into several other European languages
