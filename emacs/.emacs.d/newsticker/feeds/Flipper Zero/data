Some produced PCBs might turn out faulty, some might have barely noticeable defects like degraded radio performance. Defective Flippers must not get to users. To ensure this, all components undergo two stages of testing in production: individual electrical testing of each board and then testing of the entire assembled device.</p><p>In this article, we are going to focus on the first stage &#x2013; <strong>automatic electronic testing of individual Flipper Zero boards</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"flipper-zero-pcbs-production\">Flipper Zero PCBs Production</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/7_ts6mzo3g9mssr3stimmig_ydc.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Flipper&#x2019;s Electronics: How it&apos;s Made and Tested\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"849\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/7_ts6mzo3g9mssr3stimmig_ydc.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/7_ts6mzo3g9mssr3stimmig_ydc.png 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/7_ts6mzo3g9mssr3stimmig_ydc.png 1600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/7_ts6mzo3g9mssr3stimmig_ydc.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Flipper Zero PCBs layout</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Flipper Zero consists of 4 PCBs:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Main PCB</strong> is the main board on which the STM32 microcontroller, the display, the Sub-1 GHz module, and buttons are located</li><li><strong>iButton PCB</strong> has special iButton pogo-pins, the buzzer, and the infrared transceiver</li><li><strong>NFC_RFID</strong> <strong>PCB</strong> has RFID 125 kHz and NFC 13.56 MHz components</li><li><strong>The Antenna PCB</strong> is a combo dual-band 125 kHz + 13.56 MHz antenna, which is located right under the NFC_RFID board</li></ul><p>Every PCB is produced and tested separately.

When the resulting components have a systemic defect, you need to investigate the situation and take action to improve the process of the previous step.

Because time has already been spent on the entire production cycle and the final manual assembly of the device.

Despite having the same appearance as a usual key, these devices can be absolutely different.</p><h2 id=\"how-ibutton-works-in-flipper-zero\">How iButton works in Flipper Zero</h2><p>Developing iButton pad for Flipper Zero was a painful experience. The main problem was the absence of pads for simultaneous reading and emulation on the market. If we used any of the existing solutions, a massive metal button would be sticking out of Flipper with an equally huge reading area next to it. This would have tremendously increased the size of the device.</p><p>Therefore we had to invent our own pad design from scratch, so it could be implemented on a PCB without increasing Flipper&#x2019;s dimensions. Finally, the decision was to use 3 spring-loaded pogo pins. About 20 different designs were tested until the right one was found.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"744\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-2.png 744w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Prototypes of the iButton pad in Flipper Zero, which we 3D printed during development</figcaption></figure><p>The greatest difficulty in designing the contact pad is emulation: when the flipper itself acts as a key and must be applied to an intercom. Each manufacturer comes up with their own form of the reader so there are always intercoms incompatible with the design: the pins simply do not reach either the central Data + contact or the side GND contact.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"774\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-4.png 774w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>The left side of the pad is used for reading and copying keys, the right one serves for emulation. The center GND pin is common for both modes</figcaption></figure><p>The final iButton pad design successfully reads 100% of the keys. Approximately 80% of the readers work successfully with emulation. In the remaining 20% of the readers, it needs some time to reach the reader contacts correctly. In these rare cases, you can use the external GPIO pins, to which the iButton pins are brought out: connect with breadboard wires and poke them into the reader.</p><h2 id=\"read-mode\"><strong>Read mode</strong></h2><p>In Read Mode Flipper is waiting for the iButton key to touch and is able to digest any of three types of keys: Dallas, Cyfral, and Metakom. Flipper will figure out the type of the key itself.

For example, you can take a photo of the key&#x2019;s ID and send it to your friend who owns a Flipper without the hassle of sending the physical key itself.</li></ul><p>To launch the emulation go to the iButton -&gt; Saved menu, select the desired key and run Emulate. An inscription with the key ID will appear on the screen. After that, you can bring Flipper to the reader. It is important to remember that this mode uses different pins on Flipper&#x2019;s pad.</p><p>In the emulation mode, Flipper transmits a specific ID and emulates only one predefined key protocol, so it can only be used on the intercom which knows this key. It is impossible to iterate over several keys at once in this mode since it is impossible to make sure whether the intercom has read our key or to know the intercom&#x2019;s delay between the reading error. Therefore, for a home, office, summer residence, basement, you will need to select a respective key from the menu each time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_domofon_emulation_and_scheme.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video><figcaption>In iButton key emulation mode, Flipper must be brought to the intercom like a key.

Unlike Dallas keys, instead of voltage, they work with the current. These are less common and more expensive keys. They are very sensitive to the parameters of the key (frequency, current strength, signal amplitude, etc.), and duplicating them can be a tricky process. Cyfral and Metakom accept no commands. When power is applied to the key, it immediately starts sending the ID endlessly due to the change in resistance. Thus, the logic levels are determined by the resistance of the switch.

Empty fields contain some values, sometimes corresponding to all zeros (0x00) or all ones (0xFF). To check the intercom for such a failure, two keys are used: one with all zeros, the other with all ones. These keys contain an incorrect family code (not 0x01) and checksum (CRC)!!! - Yes, this can happen.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-postmen-bring-advertisements-into-the-building\">How do postmen bring advertisements into the building?</h3><p>No way, postmen deliver letters :) The post office doesn&apos;t possess a pile of keys for every single entrance. They normally use universal keys which are suitable for a group of intercoms in an area like all-terrain vehicles. This key can be one per city, one per group of houses, it can be default for some model, or it can be absent altogether.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-a-master-key\">What is a master key?</h3><p>Usually, this is a key that does not open the door itself but allows new keys to be added to memory. It is recorded in a separate memory area of &#x200B;&#x200B;the intercom. Such a key can be a master key for some intercoms and a usual one for others at the same time. These are just values recorded somewhere in &#x200B;&#x200B;the intercom memory.</p><h3 id=\"blocked-the-intercom-while-playing-around\">Blocked the intercom while playing around?</h3><p>This may happen if your intercom has a &#x201C;blocking key&#x201D;. It blocks the intercom for all other keys until it is unlocked with the master one.</p><h3 id=\"blank-keys-we-know\">Blank keys we know</h3><p>In the course of working with iButton, we recorded some &#x201C;blank&#x201D; keys to the table bellow.

The components are manufactured in several factories: plastic casing parts in one factory, electronics in another. Today we are reporting from the factory where the casing is made.</p><p>There are many ways to make plastic parts, but the only way to mass-produce quality parts is by <strong>injection molding</strong>. At first it may seem like this is a simple process, but in fact it is not &#x2014; designing the case and all the tooling is not much easier than designing electronics. This is why you can easily spot cheap products by low-quality plastic.</p><h2 id=\"molding-preparation-begins-at-the-3d-model-design-stage\">Molding preparation begins at the 3D model design stage</h2><p>The development of the mold begins at the stage of the 3D model design, because the molding method imposes many restrictions. The industrial and mechanical designer must use the correct draft angles and surfaces so that the part can be ejected from the mold. Any mistake here will lead to the fact that the manufacturer simply cannot produce such a part, and the design will have to be redone.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/05/IMG_0018.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Case manufacturing behind the scenes\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"818\"><figcaption>The part cannot be ejected from the mold if it is incorrectly designed</figcaption></figure><p>Openings in the case require special attention: a GPIO header, a USB hole, etc. To make such holes, the case is supported with needles from the side.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/05/IMG_0019.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Case manufacturing behind the scenes\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1737\" height=\"834\"><figcaption>GPIO needles must be movable so they can be retracted before case ejection</figcaption></figure><p>But how do we eject the case from the mold if needles block it?

Several teams work on it: developers, UI/UX-designers, and graphic designers. The interface design is complicated by the fact that Flipper has a very small screen (128 x 64px) and only five functional buttons, excluding the Back button. This creates an unusual process of designing interfaces. We have worked out this order:</p><ol><li>Initially the interface is designed as a mind map in <a href=\"https://miro.com/\">Miro</a>. This is where all the discussions, elaboration of different concepts and debates take place.</li><li>The approved interface is broken down into specific screens and rendered as 128x64 BMP images in Photoshop.</li><li>Further, the assets (graphics sets) are converted from BMP to XBM and transmitted to developers along with instructions on how to implement interactive elements such as virtual keyboards and dialogue boxes. During the implementation of the interface there are often situations when the existing programming graphics library &#xA0;doesn&apos;t allow to implement something, so we have to decide whether to rework the interface, or refine the graphics library.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/03/96895a6cbadddb2346daf321fed18f29.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Tiresome certification, opening sources, and new cool stuff\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2426\" height=\"1648\"><figcaption>RFID application structure in Miro</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the graphic interface design, it&apos;s necessary to think of a logic of movement between different states, timeouts, indications (vibration, speaker, status LED), dolphin character reactions, and dolphin level points.

Please note <code>Paid by Flipper</code> part, this is the amount we compensate when the shipping cost exceeds a promised $35.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://e.infogram.com/d0c7cf23-1ec2-45e4-8776-b68ca70721e5?src=embed\" title=\"Shipping\" width=\"890\" height=\"2650\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This chart shows the total shipping cost and how it is calculated. <strong>Shipping and taxes here are calculated for the most common $119 order, consisting of a single Flipper (without addons).</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"taxes\">Taxes</h2><p>You can see that for some countries, shipping costs several times cheaper than in others, because of zero taxes. Sad but true. Almost all of the countries have a VAT (also called a GST) &#x2014; a value-added tax that applied nearly to all the purchases within the country. Backers from countries that have an import threshold lower than Flipper&apos;s price must pay the VAT and we cannot influence their customs policy in any way.</p><p>However, for some countries with a sufficient number of orders (EU, UK, Australia, and Canada) we are able to collect the VAT in advance, this way we make the shipping prices lower and the overall process smoother as backers won&apos;t need to do anything upon receiving an order. </p><h2 id=\"what-service-will-be-used-to-ship\">What service will be used to ship?</h2><p>Most of the orders will be shipped using our custom direct injection solutions, meaning that products are transported to the destination region in bulk, but cleared as individual orders, and afterward passed to the local couriers for the last-mile delivery. This way we can make the prices much more reasonable. &#xA0; </p><p>The remaining number of orders will be shipped from our Hong Kong warehouse directly to the customer by shipping services without intermediates.

The devices will be produced gradually, starting with a very small batches and gradually increasing in volume to reduce the risk of having any defects. We really want to make a cool product that is perfect in every aspect from mechanics to electronics. Any mistake in a large batch will be fatal and it will be impossible to withdraw.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Given the huge expectations of our backers, we simply cannot afford to release an unfinished device. We will gradually produce and ship small batches to friendly developers and those who applied to the early adopters program. These people will act as beta testers, will install new firmware versions and fill the bug reports. But before you apply into an early adopters, keep in mind that you might end up with a device that has some serious bugs.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/1o/sv/kf1osvgb42n72nbbop-19mxsnw0.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Latest Sample Review.

For example, after a month of usage, buttons on the joystick may stuck occasionally, a USB port or, for example, iButton pogo-pins could break out. We will of course run automated tests, but they do not cover all potential problems that may arise. Therefore, we mark such batches as high risk. By the end of spring, we expect to have a stable mass production of fully tested devices.</p><h2 id=\"early-adopters-program\">Early Adopters Program</h2><p>If you&apos;re willing to take the risk to get Flipper early, sign up for the Early Adopters Program. You should be aware that you may face mechanical defects and other problems. You can apply <a href=\"https://forms.gle/MWoCTdqTZXD41qS76\">here</a> <strong>(only available to Kickstarter backers)</strong>.</p><p>Keep in mind that the firmware is now very unstable at the moment: it has a lot of bugs, many features are yet to be completed, the graphical interface for some features is not ready, and they have to be launched from the console without displaying them on the screen. Every day we release a new firmware builds and all beta testers will have to constantly update and test them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/mp/u9/86/mpu986dwzpeluccbuzruv2sta1o.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Latest Sample Review.

These features will be added over time in firmware updates.</p><h2 id=\"pledge-manager-launch\">Pledge Manager Launch</h2><p>Within a few days, we will open access to the pledge manager, where you&apos;ll be able to specify the shipping address and pay for delivery, select the case color and add more Flippers to an existing order.

When the resulting components have a systemic defect, you need to investigate the situation and take action to improve the process of the previous step. If this is not done, a significant percentage of the assembled devices will have problems of unknown origin.</p><p>The price of a defect discovered at the stage of the finished product is much higher. Because time has already been spent on the entire production cycle and the final manual assembly of the device. It&apos;s much more reasonable to localize the problem earlier, on a separate board, and immediately remove the defective board, than to find the problem in the finished device.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/evpfugqami-hmd8x0zkm96dqbly.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Flipper&#x2019;s Electronics: How it&apos;s Made and Tested\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1044\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/evpfugqami-hmd8x0zkm96dqbly.jpeg 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/evpfugqami-hmd8x0zkm96dqbly.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/evpfugqami-hmd8x0zkm96dqbly.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>BGA component soldering defect, two pads stuck together into one.

It is also called Dallas Touch Memory or contact memory. Even though it is often wrongly referred to as a &#x201C;magnetic&#x201D; key, there is nothing magnetic in it. In fact, a full-fledged microchip operating on a digital protocol is hidden inside.</p><p>In this article, we investigate iButton keys&#x2019; configuration from its physics to protocols along with the tricks that can be performed on them with Flipper Zero&#x2019;s help.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-ibutton\">What is iButton?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/4nfaxhmxzfvx4d-6bg7shpmsnmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"769\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/4nfaxhmxzfvx4d-6bg7shpmsnmw.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/4nfaxhmxzfvx4d-6bg7shpmsnmw.png 769w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>iButton key: DATA+ contact in the center of the casing is surrounded by plastic insulation, and the outer part is GND contact</figcaption></figure><p>Usually, iButton implies the physical form of the key and reader - a round coin with two contacts.

Sometimes the key is not read immediately because the contact PSD of an intercom is larger than it should be. So the outer contours of the key and the reader couldn&apos;t touch. If that&apos;s the case, you&apos;ll have to press the key over one of the walls of the reader.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/ibutton_reader_domofon_compressed.mp4\"></video><figcaption>iButton key contacts touch an intercom reader</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The iButton coin form factor is used not only for common keys with ID but also in climate sensors, devices storing cryptographic keys with inbuilt battery, clock and other cool stuff. Despite having the same appearance as a usual key, these devices can be absolutely different.</p><h2 id=\"how-ibutton-works-in-flipper-zero\">How iButton works in Flipper Zero</h2><p>Developing iButton pad for Flipper Zero was a painful experience. The main problem was the absence of pads for simultaneous reading and emulation on the market. If we used any of the existing solutions, a massive metal button would be sticking out of Flipper with an equally huge reading area next to it. This would have tremendously increased the size of the device.</p><p>Therefore we had to invent our own pad design from scratch, so it could be implemented on a PCB without increasing Flipper&#x2019;s dimensions. Finally, the decision was to use 3 spring-loaded pogo pins. About 20 different designs were tested until the right one was found.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"744\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-2.png 744w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Prototypes of the iButton pad in Flipper Zero, which we 3D printed during development</figcaption></figure><p>The greatest difficulty in designing the contact pad is emulation: when the flipper itself acts as a key and must be applied to an intercom. Each manufacturer comes up with their own form of the reader so there are always intercoms incompatible with the design: the pins simply do not reach either the central Data + contact or the side GND contact.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"774\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-4.png 774w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>The left side of the pad is used for reading and copying keys, the right one serves for emulation. The center GND pin is common for both modes</figcaption></figure><p>The final iButton pad design successfully reads 100% of the keys. Approximately 80% of the readers work successfully with emulation. In the remaining 20% of the readers, it needs some time to reach the reader contacts correctly. In these rare cases, you can use the external GPIO pins, to which the iButton pins are brought out: connect with breadboard wires and poke them into the reader.</p><h2 id=\"read-mode\"><strong>Read mode</strong></h2><p>In Read Mode Flipper is waiting for the iButton key to touch and is able to digest any of three types of keys: Dallas, Cyfral, and Metakom. Flipper will figure out the type of the key itself. The name of the key protocol will be displayed on the screen above the ID number.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/dallas_read_basic_compressed.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video><figcaption>Reading and saving a Dallas key to a SD-card</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To read the key, go to the iButton -&gt; Read menu and bring it to the contact pad. Now the key can be immediately emulated, copied to the memory, or saved to an SD card. Although the contact pad is located on another side of the screen, you can quickly get the hang of reading the keys without turning Flipper.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/flipper_cut_scheme_read_ibutton.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"><figcaption>The iButton read mode uses the two Flipper Zero pins on the right</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"ibutton-emulation-mode\"><strong>iButton emulation mode</strong></h2><p>In the emulation mode, Flipper itself acts as a key and emulates the iButton from the memory. An ID for emulation can be added in Flipper Zero in two ways:</p><ul><li>Read an existing key - saves the key&#x2019;s ID to an SD card for the desired key to be selected at any time.</li><li>Manually enter the key&#x2019;s ID - even if you don&apos;t have the key on you, provided its ID is known, you can input it manually. For example, you can take a photo of the key&#x2019;s ID and send it to your friend who owns a Flipper without the hassle of sending the physical key itself.</li></ul><p>To launch the emulation go to the iButton -&gt; Saved menu, select the desired key and run Emulate. An inscription with the key ID will appear on the screen. After that, you can bring Flipper to the reader. It is important to remember that this mode uses different pins on Flipper&#x2019;s pad.</p><p>In the emulation mode, Flipper transmits a specific ID and emulates only one predefined key protocol, so it can only be used on the intercom which knows this key. It is impossible to iterate over several keys at once in this mode since it is impossible to make sure whether the intercom has read our key or to know the intercom&#x2019;s delay between the reading error. Therefore, for a home, office, summer residence, basement, you will need to select a respective key from the menu each time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_domofon_emulation_and_scheme.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video><figcaption>In iButton key emulation mode, Flipper must be brought to the intercom like a key.

Using this method quite a few intercoms try to overwrite the key before reading it to avoid fake keys.

Unlike Dallas keys, instead of voltage, they work with the current. These are less common and more expensive keys. They are very sensitive to the parameters of the key (frequency, current strength, signal amplitude, etc.), and duplicating them can be a tricky process. Cyfral and Metakom accept no commands. When power is applied to the key, it immediately starts sending the ID endlessly due to the change in resistance. Thus, the logic levels are determined by the resistance of the switch. According to their documentation, it is conventionally assumed that the information words of the code are given out starting from the least significant bit.</p><h2 id=\"cyfral\">Cyfral</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/CYFRAL_ID.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1901\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/CYFRAL_ID.jpg 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/CYFRAL_ID.jpg 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/CYFRAL_ID.jpg 1600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/CYFRAL_ID.jpg 1901w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Logic levels in Cyfral, as well as in Dallas, have time limits: if the resistance remains low for about 50 &#xB5;s, this is a logical &#x201C;0&#x201D;, 100 &#xB5;s stands for a logical &#x201C;1&#x201D;. </p><p>The transmitted data format is very specific. </p><p>Cyfral sends 9 nibbles (1 nibble = 4 bits) cyclically: 1 for the start and 8 for ID.

Sometimes the key is not read immediately because the contact PSD of an intercom is larger than it should be. So the outer contours of the key and the reader couldn&apos;t touch. If that&apos;s the case, you&apos;ll have to press the key over one of the walls of the reader.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/ibutton_reader_domofon_compressed.mp4\"></video><figcaption>iButton key contacts touch an intercom reader</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The iButton coin form factor is used not only for common keys with ID but also in climate sensors, devices storing cryptographic keys with inbuilt battery, clock and other cool stuff. Despite having the same appearance as a usual key, these devices can be absolutely different.</p><h2 id=\"how-ibutton-works-in-flipper-zero\">How iButton works in Flipper Zero</h2><p>Developing iButton pad for Flipper Zero was a painful experience. The main problem was the absence of pads for simultaneous reading and emulation on the market. If we used any of the existing solutions, a massive metal button would be sticking out of Flipper with an equally huge reading area next to it. This would have tremendously increased the size of the device.</p><p>Therefore we had to invent our own pad design from scratch, so it could be implemented on a PCB without increasing Flipper&#x2019;s dimensions. Finally, the decision was to use 3 spring-loaded pogo pins. About 20 different designs were tested until the right one was found.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"744\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-2.png 744w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Prototypes of the iButton pad in Flipper Zero, which we 3D printed during development</figcaption></figure><p>The greatest difficulty in designing the contact pad is emulation: when the flipper itself acts as a key and must be applied to an intercom. Each manufacturer comes up with their own form of the reader so there are always intercoms incompatible with the design: the pins simply do not reach either the central Data + contact or the side GND contact.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taming iButton Keys with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"774\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/06/image-4.png 774w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>The left side of the pad is used for reading and copying keys, the right one serves for emulation. The center GND pin is common for both modes</figcaption></figure><p>The final iButton pad design successfully reads 100% of the keys. Approximately 80% of the readers work successfully with emulation. In the remaining 20% of the readers, it needs some time to reach the reader contacts correctly. In these rare cases, you can use the external GPIO pins, to which the iButton pins are brought out: connect with breadboard wires and poke them into the reader.</p><h2 id=\"read-mode\"><strong>Read mode</strong></h2><p>In Read Mode Flipper is waiting for the iButton key to touch and is able to digest any of three types of keys: Dallas, Cyfral, and Metakom. Flipper will figure out the type of the key itself. The name of the key protocol will be displayed on the screen above the ID number.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/dallas_read_basic_compressed.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video><figcaption>Reading and saving a Dallas key to a SD-card</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To read the key, go to the iButton -&gt; Read menu and bring it to the contact pad.

An ID for emulation can be added in Flipper Zero in two ways:</p><ul><li>Read an existing key - saves the key&#x2019;s ID to an SD card for the desired key to be selected at any time.</li><li>Manually enter the key&#x2019;s ID - even if you don&apos;t have the key on you, provided its ID is known, you can input it manually. For example, you can take a photo of the key&#x2019;s ID and send it to your friend who owns a Flipper without the hassle of sending the physical key itself.</li></ul><p>To launch the emulation go to the iButton -&gt; Saved menu, select the desired key and run Emulate. An inscription with the key ID will appear on the screen. After that, you can bring Flipper to the reader. It is important to remember that this mode uses different pins on Flipper&#x2019;s pad.</p><p>In the emulation mode, Flipper transmits a specific ID and emulates only one predefined key protocol, so it can only be used on the intercom which knows this key. It is impossible to iterate over several keys at once in this mode since it is impossible to make sure whether the intercom has read our key or to know the intercom&#x2019;s delay between the reading error. Therefore, for a home, office, summer residence, basement, you will need to select a respective key from the menu each time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_domofon_emulation_and_scheme.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video><figcaption>In iButton key emulation mode, Flipper must be brought to the intercom like a key.

Using this method quite a few intercoms try to overwrite the key before reading it to avoid fake keys.

Unlike Dallas keys, instead of voltage, they work with the current. These are less common and more expensive keys. They are very sensitive to the parameters of the key (frequency, current strength, signal amplitude, etc.), and duplicating them can be a tricky process. Cyfral and Metakom accept no commands. When power is applied to the key, it immediately starts sending the ID endlessly due to the change in resistance. Thus, the logic levels are determined by the resistance of the switch.

Data is transferred bit by bit, starting with the least significant bit of the least significant byte. Synchronization of Master and Slave is done in one act: Master (intercom) pulls the line to a low level. Then, after a specific time, Master or Slave measures the voltage on the line and writes a bit of information (Master - when reading the key, Slave - when writing the key). The timing rules for Read and Write commands are the same. Each time slot is synchronized independently, so the transmission of information can be suspended without causing errors.</p><p>All signals must have specific time limits! On occasion, the manufacturers of intercoms have the inspiration to create quite exotic time delays.</p><p>The iButton also has an Overdrive mode, in which time delays are reduced for the transfer of information to happen faster.

Empty fields contain some values, sometimes corresponding to all zeros (0x00) or all ones (0xFF). To check the intercom for such a failure, two keys are used: one with all zeros, the other with all ones.

This key can be one per city, one per group of houses, it can be default for some model, or it can be absent altogether.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-a-master-key\">What is a master key?</h3><p>Usually, this is a key that does not open the door itself but allows new keys to be added to memory.

The components are manufactured in several factories: plastic casing parts in one factory, electronics in another. Today we are reporting from the factory where the casing is made.</p><p>There are many ways to make plastic parts, but the only way to mass-produce quality parts is by <strong>injection molding</strong>. At first it may seem like this is a simple process, but in fact it is not &#x2014; designing the case and all the tooling is not much easier than designing electronics. This is why you can easily spot cheap products by low-quality plastic.</p><h2 id=\"molding-preparation-begins-at-the-3d-model-design-stage\">Molding preparation begins at the 3D model design stage</h2><p>The development of the mold begins at the stage of the 3D model design, because the molding method imposes many restrictions. The industrial and mechanical designer must use the correct draft angles and surfaces so that the part can be ejected from the mold. Any mistake here will lead to the fact that the manufacturer simply cannot produce such a part, and the design will have to be redone.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/05/IMG_0018.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Case manufacturing behind the scenes\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"818\"><figcaption>The part cannot be ejected from the mold if it is incorrectly designed</figcaption></figure><p>Openings in the case require special attention: a GPIO header, a USB hole, etc. To make such holes, the case is supported with needles from the side.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/05/IMG_0019.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Case manufacturing behind the scenes\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1737\" height=\"834\"><figcaption>GPIO needles must be movable so they can be retracted before case ejection</figcaption></figure><p>But how do we eject the case from the mold if needles block it?

The components are manufactured in several factories: plastic casing parts in one factory, electronics in another. Today we are reporting from the factory where the casing is made.</p><p>There are many ways to make plastic parts, but the only way to mass-produce quality parts is by <strong>injection molding</strong>. At first it may seem like this is a simple process, but in fact it is not &#x2014; designing the case and all the tooling is not much easier than designing electronics. This is why you can easily spot cheap products by low-quality plastic.</p><h2 id=\"molding-preparation-begins-at-the-3d-model-design-stage\">Molding preparation begins at the 3D model design stage</h2><p>The development of the mold begins at the stage of the 3D model design, because the molding method imposes many restrictions. The industrial and mechanical designer must use the correct draft angles and surfaces so that the part can be ejected from the mold. Any mistake here will lead to the fact that the manufacturer simply cannot produce such a part, and the design will have to be redone.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/05/IMG_0018.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Case manufacturing behind the scenes\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"818\"><figcaption>The part cannot be ejected from the mold if it is incorrectly designed</figcaption></figure><p>Openings in the case require special attention: a GPIO header, a USB hole, etc. To make such holes, the case is supported with needles from the side.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/05/IMG_0019.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Case manufacturing behind the scenes\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1737\" height=\"834\"><figcaption>GPIO needles must be movable so they can be retracted before case ejection</figcaption></figure><p>But how do we eject the case from the mold if needles block it?

Getting ready for production launch\"><p>The Flipper&apos;s housing consists of 11 (sic!) plastic parts made by injection molding. This is the most effective way to get quality parts in mass production. For this purpose, molds are made for each part (or a group of parts). Typically, each mold consists of two main halves and many auxiliary parts and mechanisms. Plastic will be fed under high pressure into the cavities in the mold through the inner channels.<br><br>We are currently finalising the last details with the tooling factory, which will produce all the Flipper&apos;s plastic parts in high volumes.</p><h2 id=\"the-molds\">The Molds</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a3/b15/d4c/5a3b15d4ccae512d05a99c35458bef8b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Pre-final tooling details. Getting ready for production launch\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Example of a mold (photo from tleda.ru)</figcaption></figure><p>There are many ways to make a device body: milling, 3D printing, vacuum casting into silicone molds, etc. But all of them are not optimal for mass production, when it is necessary to produce tens and hundreds of thousands of parts. In our case, the only acceptable option is the injection molding. This method allows to produce as many parts as possible with a low overall cost and high repeatability.<br><br>The process is divided into two main phases: production of the molds and production of the plastic parts batch. The molds are made using the electrical discharge and CNC milling machines, then polished and/or textured with etching or laser engraving processes. The cost of making one of these is thousands of dollars, and the cost of making a mistake is very high, both in money and time. Therefore, we carefully check all the housing parts details before starting the tooling production.</p><h2 id=\"main-body\">Main Body</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/ko/jz/vmkojzkok5z_ch0giy_eqjga67i.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Pre-final tooling details.

In our case, the only acceptable option is the injection molding. This method allows to produce as many parts as possible with a low overall cost and high repeatability.<br><br>The process is divided into two main phases: production of the molds and production of the plastic parts batch. The molds are made using the electrical discharge and CNC milling machines, then polished and/or textured with etching or laser engraving processes. The cost of making one of these is thousands of dollars, and the cost of making a mistake is very high, both in money and time. Therefore, we carefully check all the housing parts details before starting the tooling production.</p><h2 id=\"main-body\">Main Body</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/ko/jz/vmkojzkok5z_ch0giy_eqjga67i.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Pre-final tooling details.

This component filters the signal itself and maintains it at the constant logical level, amplifying if necessary. Therefore, the TSOP-75338 is able to receive even a very weak signal from small discharged remotes or signals reflected from walls. And the built-in amplifier allows you to get the same voltage levels, regardless of the IR signal strength. This greatly simplifies the software signal processing on the microcontroller side.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/2t/kq/if/2tkqifjx7-0ufixkub6f_eozoy4.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taking over TVs with Flipper Zero Infrared Port\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Flipper Zero PCB that contains IR transceiver.

Therefore, the receiver usually gets signal mixed with noise.</p><ul><li><strong>Background IR noise</strong> is created by many light sources because the source of IR light is the generated heat.

When the signal flashes at a frequency of 38 kHz, the IR pulses are picked out from the background noise.

They control a lot of settings such as temperature, fan power, etc. At the same time, the remote does not know whether the air conditioner has received the signal, it simply sends a signal every time the settings on the remote are changed.</p><p>But what will happen if we change the temperature on the remote from another room, so the air conditioner does not get that signal? For example, the value of 19&#xB0;C was set on the air conditioner, we went to another room and completely changed all the settings on the remote, setting it to 30&#xB0;C. Then we return to the air conditioner and raise the temperature by 1&#xB0;C up. If the remote simply sent a code of each button, as other remotes do, the temperature would be set to 20&#xB0;C on the air conditioner, and we would see 31&#xB0;C on the remote screen. The result would be a data desynchronization between the remote and the AC.</p><p>Therefore, air conditioner remotes, unlike other remotes, do not transmit the code of the pressed button, but all the parameters. In another word, these remotes always send ALL the remote data in one large packet.

A microcontroller in the remote makes an infrared LED blink with a specific frequency, turning the digital signal into an IR signal.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/IR_remote_huge.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/ir8_preview.jpg\">

This helps<em> </em>extract the desired IR signal and mitigates interference from visible light. The transceiver components are hidden behind that window. Flipper Zero&apos;s IR port can both receive and transmit signals.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_IR_explosion_animation_unc.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/ir_preview.jpg\">

There are some smartphones like Xiaomi, which also have an IR port, but keep in mind that most of them can only <strong>transmit</strong> signals and are unable to receive them.</p><p>The Flipper infrared receiver is quite sensitive. You can even catch the signal while remaining somewhere in between the remote and the TV. Pointing the remote directly at Flipper&apos;s IR port is unnecessary. This comes in handy when someone is switching channels while standing near the TV, and both you and Flipper are some distance away. For example, when you&apos;re in a cafe and the bartender starts channel hopping, and you want to take control of the TV by capturing the signal.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/ir_learn_new_remote_short2_compressed.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/ir2_preview.jpg\">

This way it is more convenient to hold the device in your hand while pointing the IR port towards the receiver at the same time.</p><p>To read the IR signal, it must get into the Flipper&apos;s IR window, which should be easy if you are indoors because the signal will most likely reflect from various surfaces and will hit the IR port eventually.</p><p>In order to read the IR signal navigate <code>Infrared -&gt; Learn new remote</code>. The captured signal can then be saved to a new remote. It is possible to add several signals to one remote by selecting the desired remote in <code>Infrared -&gt; Saved remotes</code>.

Such devices contain a database of signals for turning off TVs from different manufacturers. The principle of operation is the same as on Flipper: the device simply tries all known signals from its dictionary, hoping that at some moment the signal will work. Such a signal database is usually embedded in the firmware, and it is not easy to update it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/0t/5-/mj/0t5-mjkoxccv2gd8jnurycpmk7m.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taking over TVs with Flipper Zero Infrared Port\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Comparison of Flipper Zero and other devices which turn off TVs</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href=\"https://store.artlebedev.com/electronics/devices/knopkus/\"><strong>Knopkus by Artemy Lebedev</strong></a><strong> </strong>&#x2014; a simple and beautiful device in a rubberized case with one button.

This component filters the signal itself and maintains it at the constant logical level, amplifying if necessary. Therefore, the TSOP-75338 is able to receive even a very weak signal from small discharged remotes or signals reflected from walls. And the built-in amplifier allows you to get the same voltage levels, regardless of the IR signal strength. This greatly simplifies the software signal processing on the microcontroller side.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/2t/kq/if/2tkqifjx7-0ufixkub6f_eozoy4.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taking over TVs with Flipper Zero Infrared Port\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Flipper Zero PCB that contains IR transceiver.

It is needed because the microcontroller interferes with the power lines, which is why the output digital signal of the photoreceiver may not correspond to the received signal. A diode is used for voltage-matching of the TSOP receiver and the STM32 microcontroller. TSOP outputs a digital signal, which gets processed by the STM32 microcontroller.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/e7/s3/af/e7s3afwqnpl-5o7i7x2zhiwsjnc.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taking over TVs with Flipper Zero Infrared Port\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><strong>Functional blocks of TSOP-75338 IR receiver:</strong></p><ul><li>IR light filter</li><li>Sensitive IR photoreceiver</li><li>Bandpass amplifier</li><li>Automatic gain control</li><li>Demodulator for getting a signal envelope</li></ul><p>For transmission, a <a href=\"https://www.5gtechnologyworld.com/digital-modulation-basics-part-1/\">frequency-modulated</a> signal is usually used.

Therefore, the receiver usually gets signal mixed with noise.</p><ul><li><strong>Background IR noise</strong> is created by many light sources because the source of IR light is the generated heat. Therefore, the background IR noise is random. For clarity, it is depicted as a sinusoid in the video above.</li><li><strong>Modulated IR signal </strong>&#x2014; IR pulse bursts from remote.

This allows the receiver to determine the level of gain and background. There are also protocols without preamble, for example, Sharp.</p><p>Then data is transmitted. The structure, preamble, and bit encoding method are determined by the specific protocol.</p><p><strong>NEC IR protocol </strong>contains a short command and a repeat code, which is sent while the button is pressed. Both the command and the repeat code have the same preamble at the beginning.</p><p>NEC <strong>command</strong>, in addition to the preamble, consists of an address byte and a command-number byte, by which the device understands what needs to be performed. Address and command-number bytes are duplicated with inverse values, to check the integrity of the transmission. There is an additional stop bit at the end of the command.</p><p>The <strong>repeat code</strong> has a &quot;1&quot; after the preamble, which is a stop bit.</p><p>For<strong> logic &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;</strong> NEC uses Pulse Distance Encoding: first, a pulse burst is transmitted after which there is a pause, its length sets the value of the bit.</p><h3 id=\"infrared-oscilloscope-probe\">Infrared oscilloscope probe</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/07/kek-yopta.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taking over TVs with Flipper Zero Infrared Port\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1339\" height=\"1005\" srcset=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/kek-yopta.jpg 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/kek-yopta.jpg 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/07/kek-yopta.jpg 1339w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Oscilloscope captures IR signal with a &quot;silver bullet&quot;</figcaption></figure><p>For capturing IR pulses with an oscilloscope I used a self-made <a href=\"https://www.analysir.com/blog/2014/05/04/silver-bullet-oscilloscope-infrared-receiver/\">Silver Bullet</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.analysir.com/\">AnalysIR</a> author. It is just an IR LED and a resistor, soldered to an RCA audio connector, which is then connected to an oscilloscope via a <code>BNC-&gt;RCA</code> adapter.

This current raises a voltage at the LED pins, which is distinctly visible on the oscilloscope. It is important to lean the IR transmitter close to the probe, to get a clear signal on the oscilloscope.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-wrong-with-air-conditioners\">What is wrong with Air Conditioners</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3dd/39e/c16/3dd39ec16a6f6ba412fbc0006e0fabc7.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taking over TVs with Flipper Zero Infrared Port\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Air conditioner remotes send a large single package with a full list of settings</figcaption></figure><p>Air conditioner remotes are full-fledged devices with a display. They control a lot of settings such as temperature, fan power, etc. At the same time, the remote does not know whether the air conditioner has received the signal, it simply sends a signal every time the settings on the remote are changed.</p><p>But what will happen if we change the temperature on the remote from another room, so the air conditioner does not get that signal? For example, the value of 19&#xB0;C was set on the air conditioner, we went to another room and completely changed all the settings on the remote, setting it to 30&#xB0;C. Then we return to the air conditioner and raise the temperature by 1&#xB0;C up. If the remote simply sent a code of each button, as other remotes do, the temperature would be set to 20&#xB0;C on the air conditioner, and we would see 31&#xB0;C on the remote screen. The result would be a data desynchronization between the remote and the AC.</p><p>Therefore, air conditioner remotes, unlike other remotes, do not transmit the code of the pressed button, but all the parameters. In another word, these remotes always send ALL the remote data in one large packet. Such protocols are very complex.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/screencapture_AnalysIR_cut.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/ir7_preview.jpg\">

Air conditioners may have different temperature or power ranges, humidity control options, etc. Therefore the data structure may be so large, so it has to be transmitted in several batches.</p><p>Creating a universal user interface for such remotes is a challenging task, due to the inability to test multiple air conditioners and their functions. Therefore we can work with several air conditioners yet, but support for a large number of models has not been already implemented.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-analyze-ir-signals-on-pc\">How to analyze IR-signals on PC</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/ro/by/jyrobyvnoymgmyubq9wv_6qmhp4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Taking over TVs with Flipper Zero Infrared Port\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Scheme of using of AnalysIR with IR-Toy device</figcaption></figure><p>To work with IR signals on PC I use the <a href=\"https://www.analysir.com/\">AnalysIR</a>. This is a program for analyzing IR protocols and which supports different devices for IR-capturing. The most common way is to make a homemade receiver with TSOP and Arduino, and connect it via USB. I am using <a href=\"http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/USB_IR_Toy_v2\">IR-toy V2</a> as a receiver. List of supported receivers: <a href=\"https://www.analysir.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Product-Sheet-AnalysIR.pdf\">AnalysIR.pdf</a>.</p><p>AnalysIR shows the envelope of the IR signal instead of pulses, unlike an oscilloscope. The program calculates the delays and durations of pulse bursts and logs this info. It helps analyze unknown IR protocols. AnalysIR knows more than 100 IR protocols and is able to recognize them automatically. By the way, the author of the program suggested adding support for a Flipper as an IR receiver.

Our supplier promised to deliver the displays in late September and as soon as we have them, we will kick off the mass production. All this due to the screen controller, which was in extremely short supply, so the LCD manufacturer was forced to make a new screen revision with a new controller.<br><br>The only thing that separates us from starting the mass production is the lack of components. This is a factor we have no control of, and the semiconductors crisis is to blame. We&#x2019;ve covered it in depth in one of the previous <a href=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/manufacturing-and-shipping-update/\">blog posts</a>. And while we wait, we&#x2019;ve dug our noses into the firmware and mobile apps developement.</blockquote><h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/09/Temp--Online-Whiteboard-for-Visual-Collaboration-2021-09-08-15-51-47.jpg\" alt=\"Waiting for LCD Displays\"><p>We understand the backers&apos; anxiety caused by the delay. We are highly stressed by this situation too and would like to address some of the most pressing questions in this FAQ.</p><h3 id=\"when-will-i-get-my-flipper\">When will I get my Flipper?</h3><p>We will start mass production as soon as we get the LCD displays. It would be a lie to give you an exact date because the component delivery time was moved back several times already. If our supplier will follow through with their last promise, we will start manufacturing in October, and we&#x2019;ll begin shipping closer to November.</p><p>But to be honest, from what we&#x2019;ve experienced dealing with the component crisis so far, the situation is far from stable. We are constantly working on gathering all the available components and switching to alternatives when possible, but since we don&#x2019;t have any significant control over it, all we can do is be as honest and transparent as possible.</p><h3 id=\"why-not-switch-to-another-lcd-display\">Why not switch to another LCD Display?</h3><p>The LCD display is one of the central Flipper parts, around which the rest of design is made. So if we switch to another LCD now, most of the electronical and mechanical engineering would have to be re-made. This can&#x2019;t be done in one go, and it would throw us many steps back and postpone the shipping even more.</p><p>The best strategy now is to wait for the displays which were validated and tested. We already received samples of the new LCD and they are fully compatible with our current design.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-you-doing-right-now\">What are you doing right now? </h3><p>We&#x2019;re focused on Flipper&#x2019;s firmware, Android and iOS mobile apps, and on the firmware updater apps.

We&#x2019;ve covered it in depth in one of the previous <a href=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/manufacturing-and-shipping-update/\">blog posts</a>.

We are highly stressed by this situation too and would like to address some of the most pressing questions in this FAQ.</p><h3 id=\"when-will-i-get-my-flipper\">When will I get my Flipper?</h3><p>We will start mass production as soon as we get the LCD displays. It would be a lie to give you an exact date because the component delivery time was moved back several times already. If our supplier will follow through with their last promise, we will start manufacturing in October, and we&#x2019;ll begin shipping closer to November.</p><p>But to be honest, from what we&#x2019;ve experienced dealing with the component crisis so far, the situation is far from stable. We are constantly working on gathering all the available components and switching to alternatives when possible, but since we don&#x2019;t have any significant control over it, all we can do is be as honest and transparent as possible.</p><h3 id=\"why-not-switch-to-another-lcd-display\">Why not switch to another LCD Display?</h3><p>The LCD display is one of the central Flipper parts, around which the rest of design is made. So if we switch to another LCD now, most of the electronical and mechanical engineering would have to be re-made. This can&#x2019;t be done in one go, and it would throw us many steps back and postpone the shipping even more.</p><p>The best strategy now is to wait for the displays which were validated and tested. We already received samples of the new LCD and they are fully compatible with our current design.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-you-doing-right-now\">What are you doing right now? </h3><p>We&#x2019;re focused on Flipper&#x2019;s firmware, Android and iOS mobile apps, and on the firmware updater apps. The development team is independent of the manufacturing team, so we don&#x2019;t compromise one for the other.</p><h3 id=\"is-there-anything-i-can-do-to-help\">Is there anything I can do to help?</h3><p>Unfortunately, no. Unless you have a few tens of thousands of LCDs laying around. The best thing to do right now is to keep calm, keep your fingers crossed, and wait for the displays to arrive.</p><hr><h2 id=\"for-the-early-adopters\">For the Early Adopters</h2><p>The Early Adopters knew that their devices could have a hardware flaw, and there was one: the NFC and Sub-GHz subsystems in these units had problems in antenna path and were working worse than designed.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"gh-content\" style=\"margin: 12px 0; padding: 18px 20px; background: #fff7d7;\"><img style=\"float: left; max-height: 150px;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/deprecated-bin.png\" alt=\"Waiting for LCD Displays\"><p style=\"overflow: hidden; margin-top: 0 !important;\">Flippers of the <b>10.F6B8C5</b> revision which were shipped to Early Adopters will be deprecated.

It is quite common and you may see it in a lot of places: intercoms, bank cards, public transport passes, office passes, they are used to track domestic animals, for toll collection, etc. The two main RFID tag types are high frequency and low frequency.</p><ul><li><strong>Low-Frequency tags</strong> (125 kHz) &#x2014; work at a higher range. Despite being insecure and dumb, they are still used in primitive access control systems: in building intercoms, offices, sports facilities, museums.</li><li><strong>High-Frequency tags</strong> (13.56 MHz) &#x2014; have a lower effective range when compared with the low-frequency ones but have more complex protocols. They support encryption, authentication, and cryptography. These tags are commonly used in contactless bank cards, to pay for public transport, and in high-security access control systems.</li></ul><p>Here we will compare these two types of tags, take a look at the main protocols and learn to work with them using Flipper Zero &#x2014; we will read, emulate, save and clone them. You will see how you will be able to save your office, sports, home whatever RFID keys you have and we&apos;ll take a glimpse at what Flipper can read from a bank card. </p><h2 id=\"how-rfid-tags-work\">How RFID Tags Work</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/vz/f6/_a/vzf6_a87tdtfu2xyk33nosvk-ms.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>RFID chip turns on when it receives power from the reader&apos;s RF field</figcaption></figure><p>Most RFID tags are passive tags with no internal power source. The chip inside is completely turned off until the tag is exposed to a reader&apos;s electromagnetic field. As soon as it comes within range, the tag&apos;s antenna begins absorbing energy from the reader&apos;s EM field and the chip receives power. The chip then turns on and begins communicating with the reader. It&apos;s worth mentioning, that a tag&apos;s antenna is tuned to a specific frequency, so the tag can only activate when it is inside a suitable electromagnetic field.</p><h2 id=\"rfid-tag-types\">RFID Tag Types</h2><p>On the outside RFID tags can be quite different: cards both fat or thin, key fobs, bracelets, coins, rings, or even stickers. Judging by the visuals alone it&apos;s almost impossible to distinguish the frequency or protocol the tag operates on.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/aa/m6/jx/aam6jxqe9ktqlldlvrvr1yhrjwy.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>On the outside RFID tags can be quite different</figcaption></figure><p>Quite often manufacturers use similar plastic cases for different types of RFID fobs operating on different frequencies. Two absolutely visually similar tags might be totally different inside. It is worth considering when you try to distinguish the type of tag you have. In this article, we will be looking at the two most popular types of RFID tags that are used in access control systems. Flipper Zero supports both their frequencies.</p><blockquote>There is a variety of RFID protocols working on other frequencies. UHF for example uses the 840-960 MHz range. They are used for tracking assets in warehouses, paying for toll roads, tracking wild animals during their migration and so forth. These tags may have a battery and work from a couple of meters to kilometers. They are quite rare though, and you may not encounter them unless you go looking for them specifically. We will omit them entirely for the purpose of this article.</blockquote><h3 id=\"125-khz-1356-mhz-%E2%80%93-which-is-which\">125 kHz &amp; 13.56 MHz &#x2013; Which is Which? </h3><p>The easiest way to understand what range of the RFID tag is operating on is to look at the antenna. Low-frequency tags (125 kHz) have an antenna made of a very thin wire, literally thinner than a hair. But such antennas have a large number of turns, therefore, such an antenna looks like a solid piece of metal. High-frequency cards (13.56 MHz) have a significantly smaller number of thicker turns, with visible gaps between them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/hi/dc/ki/hidckijb-wsscmuqutxmkeeuama.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>With enough backlight, you can guess the card&apos;s operating frequency</figcaption></figure><p>You can shine some light through an RFID card to see an antenna inside. If the antenna has only a few large turns, it is most likely a high-frequency antenna. If the antenna looks like a solid piece of metal with no gaps between the turns, it is a low-frequency antenna.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/iq/yw/gp/iqywgpjwwkoweffxdockmhwhajy.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Low-frequency antennas have a thin wire for their turns, while high-frequency use a thicker one</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Low-frequency tags</strong> are often used in systems that do not require high security: building access, intercom keys, gym membership cards, etc. Due to their higher range, they are convenient to use for paid car parking: the driver does not need to bring the card close to the reader, as it is triggered from further away. At the same time, low-frequency tags are very primitive, they have a low data transfer rate. For that reason, it&apos;s impossible to implement complex two-way data transfer for such things as keeping balance and cryptography. Low-frequency tags only transmit their short ID without any means of authentication.</p><p><strong>High-frequency tags </strong>are used for a more complex reader-tag interaction when you need cryptography, a large two-way data transfer, authentication, etc.<br>It&apos;s usually found in bank cards, public transport, and other secure passes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/ci/q6/qz/ciq6qzytjmw78hgkvymz-lslhq8.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>125 kHz &amp; 13.56 MHz RFID tag comparison</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"low-frequency-125-khz-tags\">Low-Frequency 125 kHz Tags</h3><ul><li><strong>Long Range</strong> &#x2014; lower frequency translates to higher range. There are some EM-Marin and HID readers, which work from a distance of up to a meter. These are often used in car parking.</li><li><strong>Primitive protocol </strong>&#x2014; &#xA0;due to the low data transfer rate these tags can only transmit their short ID.

This also helps to protect the card from unauthorized interactions. The maximum read range that we managed to achieve was about 15 cm, and that was with custom-made high-range readers.</li><li><strong>Advanced protocols</strong> &#x2014; data transfer speeds up to 424 kbps allow complex protocols with full-fledged two-way data transfer. Which in turn allows cryptography, data transfer, etc.</li><li><strong>High security</strong> &#x2014; high-frequency contactless cards are in no way inferior to smart cards.

To support both frequencies we developed a dual-band RFID antenna that is situated on the bottom part of the device.</p><p>A separate NFC controller (ST25R3916) is used for high-frequency protocols (NFC). It takes care of everything related to hardware interaction with the cards: reading and emulation. Low-frequency 125 kHz protocols are implemented programmatically via a custom analog frontend, that works in cooperation with MCU and also allows to read, write and emulate.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/RFID_antenna_render_2_cut2.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/fallback_rfid_1.jpg\">

It connects to the PCB with pogo-pins. This greatly simplifies the assembly, as no cables are used and no UFL connectors are required.</p><h2 id=\"low-frequency-125-khz-protocols\">Low-Frequency 125 kHz Protocols</h2><p>Low-frequency tags store a short ID, just a couple bytes long. The tag&apos;s ID is compared to IDs stored in the database of a controller or an intercom. However, the card will transmit its ID to anyone asking as soon as it receives power. Quite often the ID is inscribed on the card itself, so you can take a picture and input it into the Flipper manually.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/post_images/afa/00c/314/afa00c3142635e9faa81e05d5fc0b6b4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><strong>Popular 125 kHz protocols:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>EM-Marin</strong> &#x2014; EM4100, EM4102. The most popular protocol in CIS. Can be read from about a meter because of its simplicity and stability.</li><li><strong>HID Prox II</strong> &#x2014; low-frequency protocol introduced by HID Global. This protocol is more popular in the western countries. It is more complex and the cards and readers for this protocol are relatively expensive.</li><li><strong>Indala</strong> &#x2014; very old low-frequency protocol that was introduced by Motorola, and later acquired by HID. You are less likely to encounter it in the wild compared to the previous two because it is falling out of use.</li></ul><p>In reality, there are a lot more low-frequency protocols. But they all use the same modulation on the physical layer and may be considered, in one way or another, a variation of those listed above.

EM-Marin cards usually have EM4100 chips inside, but there are others as well.

Flipper will attempt to determine the protocol and on success will display it alongside the card&apos;s ID. Since Flipper is trying all the protocols in one go it takes a bit of time. For example, you will need a couple of seconds to read an Indala card.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/-k/ki/zr/-kkizra4ymfljmffoc_m5ssw8cw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Unique EM-Marin ID on the card and on the Flipper</figcaption></figure><p>EM4100&apos;s unique code is 5 bytes long.

The chip inside is completely turned off until the tag is exposed to a reader&apos;s electromagnetic field. As soon as it comes within range, the tag&apos;s antenna begins absorbing energy from the reader&apos;s EM field and the chip receives power. The chip then turns on and begins communicating with the reader. It&apos;s worth mentioning, that a tag&apos;s antenna is tuned to a specific frequency, so the tag can only activate when it is inside a suitable electromagnetic field.</p><h2 id=\"rfid-tag-types\">RFID Tag Types</h2><p>On the outside RFID tags can be quite different: cards both fat or thin, key fobs, bracelets, coins, rings, or even stickers. Judging by the visuals alone it&apos;s almost impossible to distinguish the frequency or protocol the tag operates on.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/aa/m6/jx/aam6jxqe9ktqlldlvrvr1yhrjwy.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>On the outside RFID tags can be quite different</figcaption></figure><p>Quite often manufacturers use similar plastic cases for different types of RFID fobs operating on different frequencies. Two absolutely visually similar tags might be totally different inside. It is worth considering when you try to distinguish the type of tag you have. In this article, we will be looking at the two most popular types of RFID tags that are used in access control systems. Flipper Zero supports both their frequencies.</p><blockquote>There is a variety of RFID protocols working on other frequencies. UHF for example uses the 840-960 MHz range. They are used for tracking assets in warehouses, paying for toll roads, tracking wild animals during their migration and so forth. These tags may have a battery and work from a couple of meters to kilometers. They are quite rare though, and you may not encounter them unless you go looking for them specifically. We will omit them entirely for the purpose of this article.</blockquote><h3 id=\"125-khz-1356-mhz-%E2%80%93-which-is-which\">125 kHz &amp; 13.56 MHz &#x2013; Which is Which? </h3><p>The easiest way to understand what range of the RFID tag is operating on is to look at the antenna. Low-frequency tags (125 kHz) have an antenna made of a very thin wire, literally thinner than a hair. But such antennas have a large number of turns, therefore, such an antenna looks like a solid piece of metal. High-frequency cards (13.56 MHz) have a significantly smaller number of thicker turns, with visible gaps between them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/hi/dc/ki/hidckijb-wsscmuqutxmkeeuama.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>With enough backlight, you can guess the card&apos;s operating frequency</figcaption></figure><p>You can shine some light through an RFID card to see an antenna inside. If the antenna has only a few large turns, it is most likely a high-frequency antenna. If the antenna looks like a solid piece of metal with no gaps between the turns, it is a low-frequency antenna.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/iq/yw/gp/iqywgpjwwkoweffxdockmhwhajy.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diving into RFID Protocols with Flipper Zero\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Low-frequency antennas have a thin wire for their turns, while high-frequency use a thicker one</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Low-frequency tags</strong> are often used in systems that do not require high security: building access, intercom keys, gym membership cards, etc. Due to their higher range, they are convenient to use for paid car parking: the driver does not need to bring the card close to the reader, as it is triggered from further away.

Here&apos;s what we&apos;ve been doing while we had to wait for the screens and the latest production and delivery plan.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/displays_boxes--1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

More on the production plan and estimated delivery time at the end of this blog post.</p><h2 id=\"whats-new\">What&apos;s new?</h2><p>While we waited for the necessary components we kept working on the firmware non-stop. Flipper&apos;s firmware is receiving updates, bug fixes, and new features every day. All the firmware commits are logged in our <a href=\"https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/commits/dev\">GitHub repo</a> for everyone to see.</p><p><strong>More than 30 people </strong>are working on Flipper Zero<strong> full-time</strong>. A tremendous amount of work has been done already, and there is still a lot more to do. Here is what we&apos;ve done, as a brief review:</p><ul><li>Wrote over 90k lines of code </li><li>Completed more than 2000 tasks in Jira</li><li>85% of all the advertised Flipper features are working</li><li>We&apos;ve got the first app prototypes for Android and iOS</li><li>Our desktop app qFlipper is available for Windows/macOS/Linux</li><li>For 20 hard-to-get electrical components, more than 60 alternatives were selected and tested <strong>(THIS WAS A REAL PAIN)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

We&apos;ve got a real dream team that handles all this load. Thank you all for the work done in these difficult circumstances.</p><h2 id=\"new-sub-ghz-features\">New Sub-GHz features</h2><p>Our new Sub-GHz app can decrypt signals from more than 50 different keyfob manufacturers, and it&apos;s constantly being extended. We hope that with the help from the community, we will have the most complete open database of radio protocols from different manufacturers.</p><h3 id=\"frequency-analyzer\">Frequency analyzer </h3><p>In order to be able to receive a signal you first need to tune the receiver to the required frequency. But what if you don&apos;t know the frequency that the keyfob is working on? To help you with that, we have the frequency analyzer feature added to Flipper. It scans all available frequencies and displays the one that has the strongest signal nearby.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_zero_freq_analyzer_demo_compressed.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_zero_freq_analyzer_demo_compressed.mp4.jpg\">

The results displayed may be inaccurate and there is always a certain margin of error, but it will be able to tell you the frequency range you need. Most often it&apos;s one of the channels from a popular 315/433/868 MHz band.</p><h3 id=\"signal-interception\">Signal interception</h3><p>The main subjective of our Sub-GHz subsystem is to analyze the signals it captured. And right now the signal interception feature has become really powerful. You can easily find out the protocol for a particular keyfob and have the decoded signal displayed immediately. The lock icon shows if the protocol is encrypted or not. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_read_demo_compressed.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_read_demo_compressed.mp4.jpg\">

Flipper uses cryptographic keys and manufacturer codes to decrypt dynamic protocols. These files are automatically installed on the SD card with the rest of the databases during firmware upgrade. You will need to insert an SD card and update the firmware with qFlipper or Web Updater to get the latest data.
</div>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"capturing-raw-signals\">Capturing RAW signals</h3><p>There may be cases when Flipper isn&apos;t familiar with a certain protocol, but even in this case it still can capture the raw signal. This feature allows recording all the signals and dumps them straight to the SD card without trying to process anything.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_raw_signal_demo_compressed.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_raw_signal_demo_compressed.mp4.jpg\">

<div class=\"info flipper-callout\">
<div class=\"callout-header\">Flipper is not an SDR!</div>
Let&apos;s not forget that Flipper&apos;s radio is not an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio\">SDR</a>, so in order for the &quot;Read RAW&quot; feature to record the signal correctly, you need to know the exact frequency and modulation beforehand.

We&apos;ve replaced about 20 components in total. At times it was easy, but there were other times when the PCB had to be redesigned. This was quite an ordeal, because some components had a surprise in store, baffling us with things unforeseen. Here&apos;s one that was a particular source of irritation. There were actually a lot more of them, but let&apos;s showcase this one.</p><h3 id=\"the-power-struggle\">The power struggle</h3><p>This one brought us a lot of pain. In one of the <a href=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/manufacturing-and-shipping-update/#dc-dc-converters\">previous blog posts</a>, we&apos;ve noted that we have trouble buying the DC-DC converters. So we had to switch to an alternative. For example, we&apos;ve switched <a href=\"https://www.ti.com/product/TPS62743\">TI TPS62743</a> for a <a href=\"https://www.ti.com/store/ti/en/p/product/?p=LM3281YFQR\">TI LM3281YFQR</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/Temp--21---1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

We tested it in actual device circuits, and when we were about to approve the new design, it turned out that Bluetooth LE starts misbehaving under certain conditions. The insidiousness of this problem lies in that it couldn&apos;t always be reliably reproduced in tests at first.</p><p>It turns out, that 3.3v line pulsations were to blame. Despite the fact that there is nothing in the STM32WB55 datasheet about pulsations disturbing the operation of the CPU. Here&apos;s a thread on the ST forum about this issue: <a href=\"https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W000015YpgxSAC/stm32wb55-power-supply-ripplepulsation-causing-ble-tx-to-fail\">Power supply ripple/pulsation causing BLE TX to fail</a> </p><p>This is the problem itself and the solution on the oscillogram:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/LM3281_flipper_issue_power4--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

You can see pulses in the range of 40mV. This is completely normal for this microcircuit and is not a problem in itself. However, during testing, it turned out that if the rising edge happens to be faster than 6mV/us it breaks Bluetooth LE. In yellow you can see the signal we&apos;ve achieved after a little refinement.</p><p>We had to deviate from the LM3281 datasheet: we&apos;ve managed to pat down the spikes by worsening the Q factor of L14 in the LC-circuit by the means of additional resistance; and we&apos;ve also added another LC-filter, to distance ourselves from the value that caused so much trouble.</p><p>Stable subsystem work and the resulting power consumption was our top priority. If you worked with LM3281 you may want to bring up the question of PWM-mode that this chip supports having no pulsations. Unfortunately switching to PWM-mode had to be discarded early on due to additional power drain and lack of guarantees from ST that this problem only affects BLE.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/lc_filter_flipper_power.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

Flipper&apos;s firmware is receiving updates, bug fixes, and new features every day. All the firmware commits are logged in our <a href=\"https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/commits/dev\">GitHub repo</a> for everyone to see.</p><p><strong>More than 30 people </strong>are working on Flipper Zero<strong> full-time</strong>. A tremendous amount of work has been done already, and there is still a lot more to do. Here is what we&apos;ve done, as a brief review:</p><ul><li>Wrote over 90k lines of code </li><li>Completed more than 2000 tasks in Jira</li><li>85% of all the advertised Flipper features are working</li><li>We&apos;ve got the first app prototypes for Android and iOS</li><li>Our desktop app qFlipper is available for Windows/macOS/Linux</li><li>For 20 hard-to-get electrical components, more than 60 alternatives were selected and tested <strong>(THIS WAS A REAL PAIN)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

We&apos;ve got a real dream team that handles all this load. Thank you all for the work done in these difficult circumstances.</p><h2 id=\"new-sub-ghz-features\">New Sub-GHz features</h2><p>Our new Sub-GHz app can decrypt signals from more than 50 different keyfob manufacturers, and it&apos;s constantly being extended. We hope that with the help from the community, we will have the most complete open database of radio protocols from different manufacturers.</p><h3 id=\"frequency-analyzer\">Frequency analyzer </h3><p>In order to be able to receive a signal you first need to tune the receiver to the required frequency. But what if you don&apos;t know the frequency that the keyfob is working on? To help you with that, we have the frequency analyzer feature added to Flipper. It scans all available frequencies and displays the one that has the strongest signal nearby.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_zero_freq_analyzer_demo_compressed.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_zero_freq_analyzer_demo_compressed.mp4.jpg\">

The results displayed may be inaccurate and there is always a certain margin of error, but it will be able to tell you the frequency range you need. Most often it&apos;s one of the channels from a popular 315/433/868 MHz band.</p><h3 id=\"signal-interception\">Signal interception</h3><p>The main subjective of our Sub-GHz subsystem is to analyze the signals it captured. And right now the signal interception feature has become really powerful. You can easily find out the protocol for a particular keyfob and have the decoded signal displayed immediately. The lock icon shows if the protocol is encrypted or not. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_read_demo_compressed.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_read_demo_compressed.mp4.jpg\">

    Flipper uses cryptographic keys and manufacturer codes to decrypt dynamic protocols. These files are automatically installed on the SD card with the rest of the databases during firmware upgrade. You will need to insert an SD card and update the firmware with qFlipper or Web Updater to get the latest data.
  </div>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"capturing-raw-signals\">Capturing RAW signals</h3><p>There may be cases when Flipper isn&apos;t familiar with a certain protocol, but even in this case it still can capture the raw signal. This feature allows recording all the signals and dumps them straight to the SD card without trying to process anything.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><video autoplay muted loop playsinline controls style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 !important;\" src=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_raw_signal_demo_compressed.mp4\" poster=\"https://cdn.flipperzero.one/flipper_subghz_raw_signal_demo_compressed.mp4.jpg\">

  <div class=\"info flipper-callout\">
    <div class=\"callout-header\">Flipper is not an SDR!</div>
Let&apos;s not forget that Flipper&apos;s radio is not an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio\">SDR</a>, so in order for the &quot;Read RAW&quot; feature to record the signal correctly, you need to know the exact frequency and modulation beforehand.

We&apos;ve replaced about 20 components in total. At times it was easy, but there were other times when the PCB had to be redesigned. This was quite an ordeal, because some components had a surprise in store, baffling us with things unforeseen. Here&apos;s one that was a particular source of irritation. There were actually a lot more of them, but let&apos;s showcase this one.</p><h3 id=\"the-power-struggle\">The power struggle</h3><p>This one brought us a lot of pain. In one of the <a href=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/manufacturing-and-shipping-update/#dc-dc-converters\">previous blog posts</a>, we&apos;ve noted that we have trouble buying the DC-DC converters. So we had to switch to an alternative. For example, we&apos;ve switched <a href=\"https://www.ti.com/product/TPS62743\">TI TPS62743</a> for a <a href=\"https://www.ti.com/store/ti/en/p/product/?p=LM3281YFQR\">TI LM3281YFQR</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/Temp--21---1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

We tested it in actual device circuits, and when we were about to approve the new design, it turned out that Bluetooth LE starts misbehaving under certain conditions. The insidiousness of this problem lies in that it couldn&apos;t always be reliably reproduced in tests at first.</p><p>It turns out, that 3.3v line pulsations were to blame. Despite the fact that there is nothing in the STM32WB55 datasheet about pulsations disturbing the operation of the CPU. Here&apos;s a thread on the ST forum about this issue: <a href=\"https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W000015YpgxSAC/stm32wb55-power-supply-ripplepulsation-causing-ble-tx-to-fail\">Power supply ripple/pulsation causing BLE TX to fail</a> </p><p>This is the problem itself and the solution on the oscillogram:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/LM3281_flipper_issue_power4--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.

You can see pulses in the range of 40mV. This is completely normal for this microcircuit and is not a problem in itself. However, during testing, it turned out that if the rising edge happens to be faster than 6mV/us it breaks Bluetooth LE. In yellow you can see the signal we&apos;ve achieved after a little refinement.</p><p>We had to deviate from the LM3281 datasheet: we&apos;ve managed to pat down the spikes by worsening the Q factor of L14 in the LC-circuit by the means of additional resistance; and we&apos;ve also added another LC-filter, to distance ourselves from the value that caused so much trouble.</p><p>Stable subsystem work and the resulting power consumption was our top priority. If you worked with LM3281 you may want to bring up the question of PWM-mode that this chip supports having no pulsations. Unfortunately switching to PWM-mode had to be discarded early on due to additional power drain and lack of guarantees from ST that this problem only affects BLE.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/11/lc_filter_flipper_power.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Displays Arrived.
