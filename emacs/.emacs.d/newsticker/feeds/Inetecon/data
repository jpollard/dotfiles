                                    <p>In the waning days of August, in a world beset by the unending COVID19 public health crisis, by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, and by the terrible news from Afghanistan, the world’s central bankers, the rich, and the influential gathered (online) for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual Jackson Hole symposium. The title of this year’s <em>Economic Policy Symposium</em> was “Macroeconomic Policy in an Uneven Economy.” Few observers were paying attention and most had low expectations, knowing that central bankers are caught in a catch-22: they cannot lower interest rates (already at the zero-lower bound) to boost the economy, and they cannot raise rates, because the current high private and public debts are sustainable only at very low interest rates. Likewise, central bankers are unable to discontinue their accommodative (QE) policies, because this would abruptly end the irrational exuberance in financial markets and risk another global financial crash. Indeed, Fed chair Jay Powell’s speech was predictably careful, cautiously outlining how the Fed will continue its accommodative policy, while steadily monitoring data for signs of persistent broad-based inflation. No news from the monetary policy front, in other words.
</p>
<p>However, one of the contributions to the symposium, a paper by Atif Mian, Ludwig Straub, and Amir Sufi (2021), managed to make headlines in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/28/upshot/low-interest-rates.html\">New York Times</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/256acf1b-5bbb-475b-9df3-6d0b3a59389a\">Financial Times</a> (amongst others). The authors argue that high income inequality is the <em>cause</em>, not the result, of the low natural rate of interest <em>r*</em> and high asset prices evident in recent years. “As the rich get richer in terms of income, it creates a saving glut,” Professor Mian told the <em>New York Times</em>, “The saving glut forces interest rates to fall, which makes the rich even wealthier. Inequality begets inequality. It is a vicious cycle, and we are stuck in it” (Irwin 2021). In the same <em>New York Times</em> article, Professor Sufi is quoted, saying “These forces pushing down r-star are probably so powerful that the Fed could never fight against them.” Thus, central bankers are “in this story, [&hellip;] the equivalent of drivers on a highway who must adapt their speed to road conditions. The Fed has kept rates low for the past decade because those rates have been the ones that keep the economy stable. If it had tried to push them higher, the result would have been a recession.” (Irwin 2021) This message must have been music to the ears of the beleaguered central bankers, and balm for their troubled souls, because, if true, it absolves them from the responsibility for having landed the economy in the catch-22 of low interest rates, excessive indebtedness, and over-inflated asset prices.
</p>
<p>The problem with the analysis by Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021) is that it is incoherent on its own terms (<em>i.e.</em> even if we accept the deeply problematic notions of a natural rate of interest and the loanable funds market) and quite at odds with the realities of saving in modern economies. My critique comes in three parts.
</p>
<p>The first problem concerns the empirical evidence: the authors incorrectly focus on the increase in the <em>household saving rate</em>, but surely what should matter for their argument is the aggregate savings rate, the rate for the economy as a whole. I will show below that the aggregate savings rate of the U.S. did not rise, which means that even if household savings increased, there was no aggregate saving glut and hence no reason for <em>r*</em> to decrease. This already means that the key argument makes no sense on its own terms.
</p>
<p>Secondly, Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi argue that the increase in the average household saving rate must have been caused by a change in household preferences: U.S. households have, on average, become more patient and willing to postpone consumption (today) in favor of higher savings and higher consumption in the future. The authors thus conclude that the ‘rate of time preference’ of the average U.S. household has declined &mdash; which (in their reasoning) is also the reason that the natural rate of interest <em>r*</em> has declined.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their own empirical findings of changes in the class-wise household saving rates contradict this conclusion. Their empirical evidence shows that “the saving rate of the top 10% group in the post-period is similar to the pre-period. [&hellip;.] the saving rates of the bottom 90% fall considerably” (Mian, Straub and Sufi 2021, p. 21). With savings rates for one group unchanged and the other 90% of the population consuming more, the rate of time preference of the average U.S. household must have increased &mdash; which is the exact opposite of what the authors conclude. 
</p>
<p>However, the biggest problem of all is that there is no such thing as a market for loanable funds. The irrelevance of this old Wicksellian story has been explained many times, starting with Keynes (1936, 1939), but more recently by Lindner (2015), Taylor (2016), and Storm (2017). Banks pre-finance investment; investment creates incomes; people save out of their incomes; and at the end of the day, ex-post savings equal investment. This is what Bank of England economists Jakab and Kumhoff (2015) write: 
</p>
<blockquote> “&hellip;. if the loan is for physical investment purposes, this new lending and money is what triggers investment and therefore, by the national accounts identity of saving and investment (for closed economies), saving. Saving is therefore a consequence, not a cause, of such lending. Saving does not finance investment, financing does. To argue otherwise confuses the respective macroeconomic roles of resources (saving) and debt-based money (financing).”
</blockquote>
<p>There exists no market for ‘savings’ and ‘investment’ which is cleared by an equilibrium interest rate, and, hence the savings glut story of Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021) makes no sense.
</p>
<p>This note reviews the three weaknesses mentioned above and concludes that it is incorrect to view central bankers as mere “drivers on a highway who must adapt their speed to road conditions”; instead, it makes more sense to regard central bankers as the main traffic control which regulates and enforces traffic volume, speed and road conditions, in normal times and during emergencies. Together with governments and establishment economists, central bankers carry much of the responsibility for the increased inequality, slow growth, high debts, and over-inflated asset prices, however much Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi try to persuade us to believe otherwise.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>What explains the secular decline in <em>r*</em>?</strong>
</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the critique, let us first consider the argument by Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021). The paper considers two explanations of low interest rates:
</p>
<p>(1) increased household savings, driven by the baby-boom generation’s accumulation of retirement savings; this is the <em>demographic explanation</em> (see Goodhart and Pradhan 2020).
</p>
<p>(2) Increased household savings, driven by higher income (and wealth) inequality, given the fact that rich people save a larger share of their income than the middle class and the poor; this is the <em>‘inequality’ explanation</em>.
</p>
<p>Using data for the U.S. during 1952-2019, Mian, Straub and Sufi find that the impact of higher inequality overwhelms the influence on household savings from demographics. Their evidence shows that, across all birth cohorts, higher-income households have significantly higher saving rates than lower-income households &mdash; which is a stylized fact that has been known for ages, see e.g., Saez and Zucman (2016) and Taylor (2020).
</p>
<p>Figure 1 reproduces the findings of Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021): the differences in saving rates between age groups (birth cohorts) in the right panel are much smaller than the differences in saving rates between the top 10%, next 40%, and bottom 50% of households within-birth cohorts in the left panel. Mechanical life-cycle effects do not matter much and what is more, the findings of Figure 1 also disprove the assumption of a constant saving rate out of lifetime income across all households that underlies most macro models.
</p>
                          <p>Clearly, inequality is not just an end-of-pipe distributional outcome, but a central determinant of macroeconomic dynamics. To see this, note that the income share of the higher-saving top 10% of households increased &mdash; from about 30% in the early 1970s to 43% in recent years &mdash; and the income shares of the lower-saving next 40% and bottom 50% declined. Given the differential saving rates (recorded in Figure 1), the increased inequality did indeed raise the <em>overall</em> private saving rate in the U.S. by more than 3 percentage points of national income every year. This represents more than one-third of average annual private savings in recent years, or more than $ 0.6 trillion of additional annual savings. “The rise in income inequality leads to a large rise in saving,” conclude Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021, p. 21), “and therefore is a likely culprit when assessing forces that push down <em>r</em><em>∗</em>.”
</p>
<p>Figure 2 summarizes the argument of Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021). The fact of greater income inequality is taken as a given, perhaps as a result of technological progress, globalization, etc. – all factors beyond the control of central banks. Given differential saving rates by income classes, higher income inequality led to a pile-up of household savings, and a secular decline in the natural rate of interest <em>r*</em> (the red arrow in Figure 2) given this relative abundance (more on this below). The idea is that central banks had to adapt to the configuration of historical forces and thus lowered interest rates; in turn, cheap credit fuelled asset-price inflation, and with the top 10% richest households benefitting most from the resulting wealth gains, inequality spiraled up further, leading to another round of increased savings, lower <em>r*</em> and wealth gains.
</p>
<p>This, indeed, is the bottom line of the paper by Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021): central bankers, even those at the Fed, the world’s most powerful central bank, have far less power in managing the macroeconomy than is commonly believed, and the best they can do is to <em>adapt</em> to the <em>natural forces</em> of technological progress and global integration, rather than attempting to go against these inexorable currents. Accordingly, the task of the ‘science’ of monetary policymaking is limited: to follow and adapt to what is happening anyway &mdash; bending along in ways that maintain economic and financial stability. The way they frame their argument, the authors manage to kill two birds with one stone: on the one hand, they succeed in de-politicizing and ‘naturalizing’ monetary policymaking by invoking the troubled notion of the <em>natural rate of interest</em> <em>r*</em> &mdash; and on the other hand, they manage to ‘naturalize’ inequality by removing monetary policy as a key driver of growing income concentration and primarily attributing it to the ‘impersonal forces’ of technological progress and globalization, which arguably are mostly beyond policy control.
</p>
                          <p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>First problem: despite the rise in inequality, there is no savings glut</strong>
</p>
<p>If Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi are right that high inequality is the <em>cause </em>of the low interest rates, then we should observe an increase in <em>aggregate</em> savings in the U.S. Surely, the natural rate of interest <em>r*</em> is determined not just by household savings, but by <em>aggregate</em> savings.
</p>
<p>Aggregate savings, as we know from the national accounts, consist of savings by households, business, and government as well as foreign savings (which by accounting convention are equal to the difference between imports and exports). As is shown by Figure 3, the aggregate saving rate of the U.S. remained quite close to its long-term average of 25.8% (of national income) and does not exhibit a rising trend. There is no American savings glut, in other words – however much Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi would like to persuade us that there is an over-supply of savings.
</p>
                          <p>However, we can see in Figure 3 that the <em>composition</em> of aggregate savings changed. The saving rate of households averaged 11.7% (of national income) during 1980-85 and 6.7% during 2003-08; with rising income inequality, the household saving rate increased to an average of 9.7% during 2015-2019. But, all along, the aggregate U.S. saving rate remained more or less the same, because the other sources of saving offset the changes in household saving. Specifically, as the household saving rate rose during the previous decade, the government saving rate and the foreign saving rate (the trade deficit) declined; government savings even turned negative (Figure 3).
</p>
<p>This is not surprising, because the increase in income inequality led to higher household savings, lower demand, and slow growth, which in turn contributed to an increase in public deficits and a decline in the trade deficit (because of slower import growth).
</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the “natural rate of interest <em>r*</em>”, as constructed by Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021) themselves, and the national savings rate in the U.S. during 1961-2020. Their construction of <em>r*</em> exhibits a statistically significant downward trend, declining from an average of 5% during the 1960s to an average of 0.68% during 2011-2020. But as we saw already in Figure 3, the national savings rate of the U.S. shows no trend: it was 26.1% in the 1960s, 26.6% in the 1970s, 27.7% in the 1980s, 25.6% in the 1990s, 25.2% during 2001-2010, and 24% during 2011-2019. Even in 2019, the national savings rate was 25%.
</p>
<p>Three conclusions follow:
</p>
<p>1. Changes in the supply of savings (loanable funds) cannot possibly explain the secular decline in the natural rate of interest <em>r*</em>.
</p>
<p>2. To the extent that higher income inequality increased household savings, this did not lead to an increase in (aggregate) national savings, because other sources of savings (notable, public savings and foreign savings) declined. This is not surprising, because the higher average household savings depressed demand and economic growth, lowering public and foreign savings as a result.
</p>
<p>3. The secular decline in the natural interest rate <em>r*</em> cannot, therefore, in any way be attributed to rising income inequality.
</p>
<p>The key proposition of Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021) holds no water.
</p>
                          <p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Second problem: the rate of time preference of most U.S. households increased rather than declined</strong>
</p>
<p>Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021) calculate the natural rate of interest <em>r*</em> using the model of Laubach and Williams (2003). They determine <em>r*</em> as a function of <em>potential output</em> &mdash; the level of output supposedly consistent with stable inflation. I must note here that there is absolutely nothing ‘natural’ about <em>r*</em> &mdash; its value depends on the magnitude of the inflation target, set by the central bank, and also on the central bank’s understanding and measurement of ‘potential growth’. This unobservable concept is known to be slippery in the extreme (see Costantini 2015; Fontanari, Palumbo and Salvatori 2021). The argument is really that <em>r*</em> is just the interest rate which the central bank believes to be consistent with keeping inflation stable at its chosen inflation target.
</p>
<p>Without much formal ado, Mian, Straub and Sufi next interpret the secular decline in <em>r*</em>, which is what they find (see Figure 4), within the context of the standard <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive-agent Ramsey model. They do so in order to be able to give a ‘micro-founded’ explanation of the puzzle of rising household savings and a declining <em>r*</em>. In the Ramsey model, <em>r*</em> is a function of the ‘rate of time preference’ of the rational (optimizing) <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive agent.<a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/why-the-rich-get-richer-and-interest-rates-go-down#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[i]</a> Hence, Mian, Straub and Sufi argue that the decline in <em>r*</em> (for the U.S.) could only have occurred due to a steady decline in the rate of time preference of the average U.S. household. A lower rate of time preference means that the preference of the <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive agent to consume today has become less strong. As a result of this change in one of the deep behavioral parameters of average consumer behavior, the <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive agent will increase her savings rate. It needs no elaboration that this ‘explanation’ involves a leap of logic because the Ramsey model has only one <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive household and cannot tell us anything useful about the impact of higher inequality (between various income classes) and <em>r*</em>.
</p>
<p>But things get worse. I do not see how the above reasoning why <em>r*</em> decreased helps explain the actual increase in savings of U.S. households. After all, the empirical evidence of Mian, Straub and Sufi shows that the increase in the <em>average</em> saving rate of U.S. households is caused by a significant change in income distribution in favor of the higher-saving top 10% of households, and not by a fundamental change in some deep parameter of household behavior, which then led to increases in the saving rates of the three income classes. In fact, Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021, p. 21) write that “the saving rate of the top 10% group in the post-period is <em>similar</em> to the pre-period. [&hellip;.] the saving rates of the bottom 90% <em>fall considerably</em>” (<em>italics added</em>).
</p>
<p>This is shown in Table 1. The average annual saving rate of the bottom 50% of U.S. households declined by 9.4 percentage if one compares the periods (1963-82) and (1995-2019); their saving rate is negative (-6.8%) in the recent period. The average annual saving rate of the middle 40% of U.S. households declined by 3.8 percentage points between the two periods, whereas the saving rate of the richest 10% remained more or less unchanged.
</p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Hence, in terms of the concocted logic of the Ramsey model, this must mean that the rate of time preference has remained unchanged for the top 10% of U.S. households, while it must have strongly<em> increased</em> for the other 90% of U.S. households.<a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/why-the-rich-get-richer-and-interest-rates-go-down#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[2]</a> Oddly, Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi conclude that the rate of time preference of the <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive household has <em>declined</em>. This shows that invoking the Ramsey model to make one’s argument look more ‘scientific’ is not without risk &mdash; because the <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive household turns out to be not so <chrome_find class=\"find_in_page\">representat</chrome_find>ive after all.
</p>
<p>Anyway, the fact that the average saving rate of U.S. households increased in recent times is not disputed. For Mian, Straub and Sufi, it follows that the natural interest rate <em>r* </em>must have fallen to allow the transformation of the higher savings into higher investment. This final step in their argument brings us, therefore, to the market for loanable funds &mdash; where savings constitute the supply of funds and the demand for loanable funds comes from business investment. The argument by Mian, Straub and Sufi boils down to a conventional ‘savings glut’ narrative, with the narrative twist here being that the glut is caused by higher income inequality.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Final problem: the loanable funds market does not exist</strong>
</p>
<p>In my view, the biggest problem with the argument of Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi (2021) concerns the claim that a glut of savings <em>causes</em> the natural interest rate <em>r*</em> to fall. The simple (but incorrect) idea is that an excess supply of savings (relative to investment demand) must lead to a decline in the ‘price’ of savings, which in this story is the interest rate. Savings constitute the supply of loanable funds, while investment represents the demand for loanable funds, and similar to the market for potatoes or wooden shoes, an excess supply depresses the market price. This ‘market for loanable funds’ is illustrated in Figure 5: the curve for the supply of loanable funds shifts to right (because savings increase, at a given rate of interest, because of rising inequality), and the new equilibrium interest rate <em>r*</em> is lower than before. If this sounds like J. B. Say, it’s because it is. Because all savings (in this story) are converted into investment, equilibrium interest rate <em>r*</em> ensures that the economy is operating at its potential; hence, <em>r*</em> is labeled the ‘natural rate of interest’.
</p>
                          <p>Through textbooks and papers published in the so-called top journals, the loanable funds model has been hard-wired into the belief system of most economists, even if it was shown to be a myth already more than eighty years ago by John Maynard Keynes (1936). The utter irrelevance of the loanable funds model for our monetary production economies is explained more recently by Lindner (2015), Taylor (2016), and Storm (2017). Suffice it to say that (business) investment is not financed by (already available) savings, but by (newly created) bank credit, and the volume of bank credit depends on banks’ ability and willingness to provide credit; crucially, banks are not just intermediaries pushing around existing money, but money-creating institutions which can make new money <em>ex nihilo &mdash; a point both the Fed and private banks understand very well, as their behaviour during bailouts shows. </em>Pointing out the loanable funds fallacy, Keynes wrote in “<em>The Process of Capital Formation</em>” (1939): “Increased investment will always be accompanied by increased saving, but it can never be preceded by it. Dishoarding and credit expansion provides not an alternative to increased saving, but a necessary preparation for it. It is the parent, not the twin, of increased saving.”
</p>
<p>In sum, trying to make sense of their empirical findings on inequality and household savings for the ‘real world’, Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi end up telling us a completely fictitious story of a non-existing non-representative agent who for some unexplained reason lowers her rate of time preference and raises her savings, with the ultimate result that a non-existing natural rate of interest <em>r*</em> goes down in some fictitious loanable fund market. Some economists urge us to see economics as ‘storytelling’ (Shiller 2017), but surely the fact-and-fiction-blurring surrealism by Professors Mian, Straub and Sufi is taking this idea of a ‘narrative economics’ to an altogether different level.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>An alternative, far more plausible explanation</strong>
</p>
<p>Let me conclude by offering a more plausible narrative to explain why higher inequality did cause low interest rates and over-inflated asset prices. The alternative explanation is shown in schematic form in Figure 6.
</p>
<p>The key driver of rising income inequality is the stagnation of real wage growth for the bottom 80% or so of U.S. households (Taylor and Ömer 2020). Real wage growth was suppressed below labour productivity growth, and this led to a secular decline in the share of wages (and a rise of profits) in national income. The main cause of the wage growth suppression has been the abandonment of full employment as the primary target of macro policy-making, in favour of inflation control, at the end of the 1970s. Fiscal policy was deprioritized in favor of monetary policy, conducted by independent central banks, single-mindedly focused on building credible reputations as inflation hawks, and counter-cyclical fiscal stabilization was made anathema by subjecting fiscal policy-making to rigid and deflationary rules, irrespective of the business cycle. For a period of time after the global financial crisis of 2008, austerity zealots, dreaming of expansionary fiscal consolidations, intensified the fiscal repression, bringing about one of the slowest and most costly economic recoveries from a crisis in history. 
</p>
<p>Labour markets were enthusiastically deregulated, with the explicit and generous approval of central banks and governments, to break the structural inflationary power of unions and to create a flexible reserve of surplus workers with no choice but to work in temporary low-wage jobs in what is now known as the ‘gig’ economy. Globalization and offshoring contributed to breaking the countervailing power of organized workers because they offered corporations (the threat of) an opt-out possibility that was not available to workers. Taken together, the change in macroeconomic policy regime produced a structurally low-inflation economy, based on ‘traumatised workers’ in precarious jobs, who could not plausibly fight for higher wages and more secure employment conditions, given their daily struggles and the systemic biases they are facing. The wellspring of cost-push inflation had been radically removed.
</p>
<p>Stagnant wages and incomes for the 90% mean that income (and wealth) inequality rises and that aggregate household savings go up (as shown by Mian, Straub and Sufi). Higher household savings reduce consumption demand, which holds up fixed business investment for the domestic market. In effect, aggregate demand growth stagnates, and pressures for demand-pull inflation evaporate. With inflation (and expected inflation) being low in structural terms, central banks lower the interest rate, in accordance with the recommendations based on the monetary policy rules proposed by establishment economics.
</p>
<p>The low interest rates, in turn, fuel asset-price bubbles, creating wealth gains for the rich, and over-indebtedness for the bottom 90% of households, which use cheap credit to finance essential expenses on education, medical care and housing. This reinforces wealth and income inequalities, and pushes up asset prices even more, but this does not lead to higher economic growth and better jobs, because the richest 10% use their savings and wealth gains not for investments in the real economy, but to speculate in financial markets. The past two decades have made it abundantly clear that the gains made by the top 10% in financial markets do not trickle down to the real economy.
</p>
                          <p>The low interest rate is, therefore, not a ‘natural’ rate at all, but a highly un-natural rate, which is imposed on a stagnating and highly unequal economy by central bankers who have no reason to raise rates (since structural inflation pressures have been eroded) but who cannot lower them further (because of the zero-lower bound). More than a decade ago, central bankers reached the end of the road when it comes to interest rate policy, and they were left with the option to revive the real economy by means of unconventional QE. In the present system, and given establishment thinking, this was probably the only &mdash; and therefore best &mdash; option left to central bankers, but while QE did succeed in preventing another crisis and keeping the economy on life-support, it failed to revive the real economy and enhanced the already considerable asset-price inflation. Monetary policy-makers find themselves in a catch-22, and they have themselves to blame for this.
</p>
<p>So, what is the way out of the <em>impasse</em>, if there is one? The only way involves a rethinking of the dominant macroeconomic model, a reprioritization of full employment as the prime target of macro policy, and a return of active fiscal policy, supported (but not constrained) by monetary policy. Higher wages, progressive redistribution (not just of income, but also of wealth), and more public spending, financed by progressive taxes and generating balanced-budget multiplier effects, constitute essential ingredients in any sensible macroeconomic strategy.
</p>
<p>Macroeconomists must give up the fatalism implied by using concepts such as the ‘natural’ rate of interest or the ‘natural’ unemployment rate. Central bankers cannot hide behind such metaphors and diminish themselves to being mere “drivers on a highway who must adapt their speed to road conditions.” There is nothing ‘natural’, inevitable, or preordained about economic concepts, as these are all social constructions. There is nothing natural about the current Catch-22, which was created with the active help of monetary policymakers and establishment economists, who try to shift responsibility on what they label ‘natural forces’. Instead of the fatalism of establishment economics, we must return to the work of economists who did not evade responsibility and used economic thinking to understand the world and to improve it.

Hence, in plain English, what the authors are saying is this: “we don’t have a clue why <em>r*</em> declined, but we believe that it is caused by the fact that the average U.S. household has become more patient and more inclined to save today to have higher consumption in the future.

                                    <p>It was a bad week for freedom in America. With Texas banning most abortions and empowering self-appointed vigilantes to stop women from exercising their right to reproductive healthcare, and the Supreme Court letting it stand, you’d think freedom-loving libertarians would be out in full force protesting.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>After all, libertarians describe themselves as principled foes of state coercion and passionate defenders of individual liberty. While they may give different weight to principles of individual liberty, self-determination, and so on, libertarians claim to be highly skeptical of government intrusion into our lives. Wikipedia informs us that <a href=\"https://lpedia.org/wiki/Pro-Choice_Libertarians\">most generally agree</a> that sperms, eggs, and fetuses are not persons with rights.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In his 1982 book, “The Ethics of Liberty,” libertarian economist Murray Rothbard wrote that “the proper groundwork for analysis of abortion is in every man's absolute right of self-ownership. This implies immediately that every woman has the absolute right to her own body, that she has absolute dominion over her body and everything in it. This includes the fetus.\"
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>That’s clear enough. Now is the chance for libertarians to stand up for what they believe, <a href=\"https://www.lp.org/libertarians-abortion-is-a-matter-for-individual-conscience-not-public-decree/\">stated thus</a> since 2008 in the official Libertarian Party platform:
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<blockquote>“Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration.”
</blockquote>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Got it. My decision to give birth is for me to decide, not the state. Very reasonable.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Let’s check out how America’s most influential libertarians have been responding to the Texas Taliban and the most flagrant disregard for a woman’s personal liberty seen in a generation.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Give it to them, guys!
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>To get their take, I first consulted a <a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/BestLists/libertarians-newsmax-freedomfest/2017/06/01/id/793510/\">list of libertarian heavyweights</a> put together by Newsmax. Helpfully, the editors share their criteria for selection:
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<blockquote>“To compile this list, our editors defined a libertarian as a consistent advocate of free-market capitalism, minimal government, and social tolerance (thus distinguishing libertarians from conservatives). Their motto might be \"Keep government out of the boardroom and the bedroom.\"
</blockquote>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Social tolerance! Out of the bedroom! Right on.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>According to Newsmax, the two top libertarians are former congressman Ron Paul and his son, Senator Rand Paul.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Ron Paul styled his 2008 run for the presidency as a “Campaign for Liberty.” Yet on the stump, he consistently denounced a woman’s right to make the most private decisions of her life. He wrote a book called “Liberty Defined,” but surprisingly, his definition did not include a woman’s sovereignty over her own body. Instead, he complained that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we_read_so_you_dont_have_to_ron_pauls_liberty_defined/2011/05/13/AFFjsk2G_story.html\">taxpayers should be at liberty not to pay for abortions</a>.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Like a good libertarian, Paul is very clear in the book that torture of any sort is reprehensible and sadistic. Yet oddly, he does not consider that torture might be a proper word to describe what is done to a woman forced to undergo an extremely painful and potentially life-threatening physical experience against her will.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On abortion, Senator Rand Paul goes even further afield of libertarian principles than his dad, calling himself \"totally pro-life\" and supporting \"any and all legislation that would end abortion or lead us in the direction of ending abortion.” In fact, he wants federal control of women’s bodies, stating, “I believe in a Human Life Amendment and a Life at Conception Act as federal solutions to the abortion issue.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>It turns out that America’s most influential libertarian politicians are in strong opposition to the party’s own platform and principles.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the pandemic rages, Senator Paul has lost no opportunity to vociferate against Covid-19 safety measures and make rousing speeches to his Twitter followers on the need to “stand together” for freedom and resist mandated mask-wearing. Yet on the matter of mandates to endure pregnancy, labor, and childbirth, perhaps having your body ripped open or sliced, and permanently altered, evidently Paul considers this less constraining to personal freedom than affixing a thin piece of cloth to your nose.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>So far, on the Texas abortion ban now dominating the headlines, the two libertarian giants have said&hellip;pretty much nothing.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just something about being a politician that makes libertarians confused. Perhaps the intellectual stars of the movement can offer more consistency.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>How about Ed Crane, former head of the Cato Institute and currently pundit-at-large on matters of freedom? The man the Wall Street Journal calls the champion of “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204425904578072773385074286\">free people and free markets</a>” will certainly stand up for the liberty of women. Some years ago, Crane called himself a “<a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/key-issue-court-isnt-abortion\">pro&dash;choice advocate</a>,” though he insisted there were far more important matters to deal with, such as private property rights. Nevertheless, he is said to be among the most well-reasoned of libertarians -- the man you turn to when you want to hear something sensible.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Currently, Crane is talking about all kinds of things, like <a href=\"https://www.termlimits.com/nut155/\">term limits</a>, and tweeting about the need to defend civil liberties. So what does he say about the frontal assault on the liberty of 7 million women in Texas, and likely millions more in other states that try to copy the Texas law?
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, nothing. Nada. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edwardhcrane?lang=en\">recently retweeted</a> a great line about how libertarians love the liberty of others. But there is no mention of the millions of American women currently filling up that “others” category.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Possibly, Crane is too chagrined by his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/08/ed-crane-cato-institute-sexual-harassment-398989\">sexual harassment accusations</a> to opine on women’s rights at this time.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Fine. We’ll move over to a younger generation of thinkers, the Gen X libertarian luminaries Nick Gillespie, editor of Reason.TV and Reason.com, and Matt Welch, Reason Magazine's editor-in-chief. Reason is the Bible of the libertarian movement and these two talk about every subject under the sun. Undoubtedly, they can tell us how libertarians are going to confront the authoritarian terror of the Texas Taliban.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Back in 2011, the pair, who co-authored a book called, “The Declaration of Independents: How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What's Wrong With America,” got down to business in a video titled, “What’s the Libertarian position on abortion?” Gillespie and Welch are asked, “If libertarian philosophy puts individual rights paramount, shouldn’t libertarians oppose abortion?” 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Very straightforward.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Gillespie reveals that while the majority of libertarians are pro-choice, a 30% minority is “anti-abortion.” While stating that you can be a libertarian and have that view (though not elaborating on exactly why), Gillespie is clear that he does not personally agree with the anti-choice position. “Abortion should be legal,” he affirms. For his part, Welch waxes philosophical about changing mores and the “sliding scale of humanity from egg to fetus to a viable fetus that can live outside the womb,” assuring us that thanks to the wonders of medicine and “more ways of controlling our sexuality and our reproduction&hellip;we are actually seeing the minimization of abortion as a major issue in American politics.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>I guess nobody told Welch that women in the United States are still not even able to purchase the 60-year old medical wonder known as “birth control pills” at the drug store. Or that his prognosis of the direction of American politics is about as wrong as it’s possible to be. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>But maybe now that the topic is white-hot in the news and the freedom of millions of women is at stake, these two august journalists will weigh in. I checked out their Twitter feeds for the last few days.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Gillespie is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickgillespie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">tweeting about the cobb salad</a> at his favorite New York restaurant.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Welch is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattWelch?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">focused on Afghanistan and defending free speech against cancel culture</a>.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On the Texas law and the Supreme Court’s enabling of the assault on female liberty? Crickets.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Over at Reason mag, there is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2021/09/03/conservatives-should-worry-about-the-texas-abortion-law-too/\">one lone writer who published a quibble with the law</a> (scroll down below articles on homeschooling and the freedom to vape). His main point is to warn conservatives that a similar strategy could be used to take away their guns.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>I could find but one person connected to Reason who seems to think there’s anything wrong with vigilantes collecting bounties for spying on women – a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizzywol/status/1433122968956190726\">tweet from Liz Wolfe</a>, Reason staff editor. Good for Liz, but this same person was not so very long ago lambasting pro-choicers for spreading “propaganda” on the dangers of abortion restrictions, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizzywol/status/1129424615443447808\">blithely predicting</a> that “tech advancement might render all this (mostly) pointless to sort out anyway.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Tell that to <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/02/texas-abortion-out-of-state-people-of-color/\">low-income women</a> in Texas, many of them women of color and immigrants, who are watching their futures destroyed and their internal organs commandeered, unable to afford the now-average 248-mile journey to an abortion clinic and the high costs and waiting periods imposed by anti-choice activists.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>So much for Reason.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Ok, if the politicians and pundits aren’t standing up for their movement, perhaps the denizens of Silicon Valley, famous for their libertarian leanings, will take up the charge to fight the grotesquely coercive Texas law.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>While not as outspoken about his political leanings as some of his tech-bro libertarian colleagues, entrepreneur Elon Musk has been noted for taking libertarian stances. The Financial Times refers to him as “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/725abfc2-9697-11ea-abcd-371e24b679ed\">space pioneer, electric car guru and cantankerous libertarian</a>,” while his good friend Scott Painter calls him a “very libertarian, free-market type.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Musk has been quite exercised on the topic of freedom recently. He has called quarantine measures “fascist” and railed against any government “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/30/musk-coronavirus-quarantines/\">forcibly imprisoning</a>” people in their homes with shelter-in-place policies. Outraged that California Covid shutdowns were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/725abfc2-9697-11ea-abcd-371e24b679ed\">costing him revenue</a> and sure that the virus would be gone in April (2020!), the billionaire packed his bags last year and moved to Texas.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Musk has offered this definition of freedom: the “<a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/define-freedom-this-is-what-elon-musk-had-to-say-11627659448927.html\">maximum set of possible future actions</a>.” Sounds like he wants people to be able to make lots of choices for themselves. That makes sense.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Surely, he would agree that forcing a woman to give birth against her will is sawing off large branches of her decision tree. Possibly, she will no longer have a tree at all, because she will be dead.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Yet Governor Greg Abbot of Texas <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-supports-texas-abortion-ban-claims-governor-1847610572\">recently bragged</a> that he could count on businessmen like his friend Elon Musk to back him up on the abortion law: “Elon consistently tells me he likes the social policies in the state of Texas,” said the gov.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Musk responded with a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-supports-texas-abortion-ban-claims-governor-1847610572\">Texas two-step of a tweet</a> around the subject: “In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness&hellip;That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This is a bit confusing. He was way into politics a minute ago on the whole Covid thing. And if he felt that the Governor’s suggestion that he supported the Texas abortion law was inaccurate, he could certainly set the record straight. He might, for example, point out that coercing women into having unwanted children is a crystal-clear example of the state imposing its will upon the people, and making a lot of them miserably unhappy. A person who has been raped by her father, brother, or uncle, for example, would be unlikely to experience maximum happiness in being ordered to birth his baby. Musk is reputed to be very smart. He must have some insight. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>But that tweet is evidently all he has to say. His feed is now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">extolling the virtues of space travel</a>. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>What about that most famous of libertarian contrarians, the tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel? Thiel is so adamant that the government stay out of his life that he once proposed the idea of a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2018-03-peter-thiel-founded-floating-island-sunk-paradise.html\">floating libertarian utopia</a> where bureaucrats couldn’t bother him.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In 2017, Thiel did indeed <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/11-perfectly-good-and-normal-quotes-from-peter-thiels-n-1791093562\">weigh in on the subject of abortion and politics</a> with this prescient gem: “It’s like, even if you appointed a whole series of conservative Supreme Court justices, I’m not sure that Roe v. Wade would get overturned, ever. I don’t know if people even care about the Supreme Court.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Given the rocket-sized hole blasted into this theory by recent events, it sure would be interesting to hear what is Thiel is currently thinking about.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/peter-thiel-calls-bitcoin-a-chinese-financial-weapon-at-virtual-roundtable?utm_medium=social&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">Bitcoin as a financial weapon of the Chinese</a>, of course.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In desperation, I scrolled down the Newsmax list to find an influential libertarian woman who would hopefully show some spine in defending the cause. I had to keep scrolling because there weren’t any women in the top 25. Finally, I found somebody who looked promising: Jennifer Grossman. She’s that rara avis, a libertarian feminist, and besides that the CEO of the Atlas Society, to the ideas of the doyenne of libertarianism, Ayn Rand.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Now we’re talking! Ayn Rand didn’t mince words on the subject of abortion. She described the notion that a fetus has rights as “vicious nonsense.\" The famous <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2011/11/14/142300606/ayn-rand-conservatives-pro-abortion-anti-religion-inspiration\">thinker laid out her position</a> in 1968 in “The Objectivist”:
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<blockquote>“An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, only to an actual being. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living take precedence over the not-yet-living (or the unborn).”
</blockquote>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rand didn’t stop there: “Abortion is a moral right&mdash;which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body?\"
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Who, indeed? Not a bunch of Texas politicians, one would think! As a feminist Randian, Grossman couldn’t possibly remain silent as the expressed tenants of her hero are violated on a gigantic scale.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>I perused Grossman’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenAnjuGrossman\">Twitter feed</a>. Unfathomably, I could find absolutely nothing about the Texas abortion law. I went over to the Atlas Society website, where she blogs. There were some interesting musings about women, including an account of an <a href=\"https://www.atlassociety.org/post/my-time-with-jeffrey-epstein\">alarming weekend</a> she spent with the predator Jeffrey Epstein, whom she briefly considered dating. I saw some strong stuff about the badness of sexual harassment, and plenty of female empowerment messages.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>But zilch on the Texas abortion law, or on the subject of abortion, period. A big zero.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>So there you have it. Try as I might, I could not find a single influential libertarian exerting their influence on behalf of the freedom of the women of Texas. Despite the Texas government’s extreme coercion and its egregious violation of their most basic personal freedom. Despite the majority of libertarians who say they are pro-choice. Despite the Party’s own platform and stated beliefs.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>I would like to be wrong. Please let me know if you see any influential libertarians in the media protesting the Texas outrage. Or marching in the streets on behalf of women’s reproductive freedom.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>But if I am understanding all this correctly, I have to conclude that a libertarian is someone who will defend a woman’s right not to wear a medical mask during a pandemic, but inexplicably holds that choices about her body, her health, her economic situation, and her entire life trajectory, belong to the government. Let freedom ring?
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time to fix what’s wrong with libertarianism.

                                    <p>In Europe, imbalances in the structure of the automotive sector – themselves the result of the liberalization of capital movements and companies – and a lack of industrial policies risk creating a deadly cocktail for millions of European workers just as the auto sector is undergoing decisive changes.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Changes in mobility styles, environmental and transport forms, and the transformation of propulsion systems require strong political intervention, capable of combining industrial, social, and environmental objectives. Letting the market decide how, when and at what cost this transition occurs will guarantee disastrous outcomes for many workers and, indeed, entire countries.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In recent decades, Europe has experienced a dramatic redistribution of car production volumes between countries. Volumes in general have declined, as have jobs, albeit at different intensities: While Germany has maintained its role as the main manufacturing country, Italy has seen its car production fall to the levels of countries such as Romania and Hungary. By contrast, central and eastern European countries, together with Turkey, saw very substantial increases in production volumes. In these countries, the location and investment strategies have all been decided and implemented by the major car manufacturers, in particular German and French producers.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The European Union has been characterized by the total absence of industrial policies in the car sector; or rather, its policy choices have been aimed at ensuring that car manufacturers can reorganize their production on the basis of their economic advantages (low labor costs, low level of social legislation, etc.). Such interventions as it does make do nothing to shape the industry’s development trajectories: there are plenty of public resources earmarked for R&D, worker training, and business competitiveness, but without establishing either objectives or the public instruments through which to achieve them. In short, everything important is left to the logic of the market as detailed in our <a href=\"//www.ineteconomics.org/research/research-papers/automotive-global-value-chains-in-europe\">new INET Working paper</a>.</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In the absence of concerted action, several countries have introduced national plans that include measures both on the demand side (incentives for the purchase of \"green\" cars, incentives for the renewal of public fleets, etc.) and on the supply side (support for investments, the industrial chain, etc.).
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>These national plans have at least two worrying aspects. Firstly, only a few countries have them – Germany, France, and Spain), while the others have not equipped themselves with any instruments for action. Secondly, the plans have exclusively national horizons, with the risk of increasing competition between EU member states instead of cooperation.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This lack of European industrial policies is showing all its fragility in the field of batteries for future electric cars: in order to catch up with Asian producers, new investments are planned in Europe to build up production capacity. But decisions on new battery plants for electric cars are the exclusive prerogative of private companies, without any planning or steering role on the part of the European public authorities.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Thus, a fierce new competition is about to be unleashed between European countries, as shown by the location choices for these investments described in our Working Paper.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>When it comes to electric vehicles, although the generic term 'electric' is used to refer to these drives, there are in fact major differences: battery electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, series-hybrid, parallel-hybrid, complex-hybrid – all are models with significant differences between them. Within the large family of electrified vehicles, there are many different models; most of which continue to maintain the internal combustion engine. Only the Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is propelled solely by electric motors, with battery packs sourcing the power (battery packs are recharged on the electricity grid).
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This clarification is important both to correctly read the data on the market shares of the various propulsion technologies and to frame the issue of components with its corollary of employment levels.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The number of components needed for a battery-electric vehicle is much lower than vehicles with an internal combustion engine, but at the same time, the hybrid vehicle needs the most parts and components. Consequently, the hybrid vehicle seems to be the one that can best reconcile environmental and social-employment objectives.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>But even in this case, the EU has not adopted any guidelines other than on emission levels, leaving all decisions on industrial and investment choices to the market.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The absence of European policies also risks leaving unresolved the problem of the supply chain necessary for battery production, keeping Europe in a condition of high dependence on foreign countries.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The issue here is not simply dependence on raw materials, which obviously rests on their availability in various geographical areas, but also and above all on the industrial phases: for example, the refining of cobalt, lithium, nickel, and manganese; the production of anodes and cathodes; the production of cells for batteries, etc.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In all these industrial stages, Europe is dependent on production by companies in other geographical areas, particularly in Asia.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>With the development of electric cars, without an adequate European industrial structure, this dependence will increase further. Yet here again the European Commission has confined itself to launching initiatives relating only to research & innovation and the industrial dissemination of innovative solutions; in short, no direct investment.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In Italy, the automotive sector is in danger of being further compromised by the creation of Stellantis, the result of the merger between the French company PSA and the Italian company FCA.
</p>
<p>The choices made by the French component of Stellantis will determine the company's future: for example, the technological architecture of PSA is being adopted for the production of mass-market vehicles, with important consequences for all components. The same can be said about powertrain choices.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>For Italian suppliers, therefore, a very worrying future lies ahead, and the Italian Government is not taking any form of action to protect employment levels and the national industrial structure. Unfortunately, not even the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, adopted by the Italian Government to make use of funding from the Next Generation EU plan, provides for any public sector intervention capable of directing and guiding such an important sector as the automotive industry. It is not hard to foresee what is going to happen: a further deepening of the European south’s dependence on the north with further migration of value added from the periphery to the core of Europe.

                                    <p><em>Back in January 2021, Phillip Alvelda issued a warning. Alvelda is a former NASA & DARPA technologist-turned-entrepreneur who runs Brain Works Foundry Inc. and Medio Labs, U.S.-based developers of A.I. enhanced health care technologies and services. He said</em><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/new-covid-super-strain-is-a-game-changer-for-schools-and-more\"><em> that a new variant of COVID-19 would spell disaster</em></a><em> without a change in mindset and a rapid, robust response. Today, as several U.S. states experience some of the worst outbreaks on the planet due to the delta variant, Dr. Alvelda sounds the alarm that the calculations for beating the pandemic have changed and we need to catch up. He explains to Lynn Parramore of the </em><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/\"><em>Institute for New Economic Thinking</em></a><em> that while vaccines must be the foundation of our response, additional measures are required to prevent ongoing – and unnecessary -- suffering and death.</em>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Parramore: Why is it wrong to think of the delta situation as “just another surge”?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Philip Alvelda: We have quite a lot of information from all of the countries that have been beset by the delta variant before us. It began in India and was transmitted very quickly to India’s close trading and tourism partners. The U.K., of course, was one of the first affected by the new wave, but it hit broader Europe – France, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain, and so on. Israel was hard hit as well. So, we have data on the expected course of the disease, the number of people an infected person transmits the virus to, and so on. We have laboratory data that show how even a completely vaccinated person – someone with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine – sheds as much virus for the first six days as someone that hasn’t been vaccinated. We can see that with delta, the disease ramps up substantially faster in the body when you’re infected than the original Wuhan strain, where it used to be four days before you would become infectious and could spread the disease to others. With delta, you can ramp up from the point where we can just barely detect the virus with our best PCR test all the way to full infectiousness within one day.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>If you take all of those things together, you realize that this strain is quite a bit more problematic to contain. We’ve watched these other countries go through the process of realizing exponential growth in the disease -- faster than we’ve ever seen it before. We also see that the old abatement measures worked up to a point and then just started to fail. These countries have had to do more than they were doing before to contain the virus. So it’s definitely not “just another surge.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: In the U.K., many have felt hopeful that the pandemic is under control after a rapid rise in delta infections was followed by a significant drop. Others note that the virus is unpredictable and cite indications that case numbers are ticking back up. What’s your view?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: When we look at the reasons for the change in the trajectory of delta in the U.K., we see two really big changes that heralded the peak. One was the end of the Euro soccer tournament, which we know was a whole series of superspreader events. We know how many young men had caught the virus by the end of the matches and so on. That tournament ended just prior to the decline in cases. The other thing that happened right before the decline was that school was let out, so no more in-person classes. The schools were a huge spreading agent. We’ve now tracked the variants and the disease prevalence by age, and it’s clear that the school-bound cohorts spread the virus like crazy before school ended, and then when school ended, cases in that cohort starting to decline rapidly. So we know that the Euro games and the school closings were the big things that had an immediate effect. But school is coming back into session and they’re continuing to have additional soccer games, although not to the same extent as the Euro finals.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can actually see in the numbers over the last week that the U.K. is back to exponential growth of the delta variant. So far, it’s relatively modest exponential growth, but still exponential. This is not speculative. It’s happening.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: So we can say with certainty that the U.K. is not out of the woods?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: No, it isn’t out of the woods. Looking at the different age cohorts and looking at the different regions in the U.K., you can see that the decline was not universal. There were some demographics where you had broad decline like the schools, and others which were flat, and now we’ve got a whole set of them that are increasing once again.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: You note that vaccines are currently working very well for personal protection, with far less hospitalization and death for vaccinated people who contract the delta variant than those who are unvaccinated. But you warn that current vaccines no longer work well enough for public health suppression of delta. What exactly does that mean?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: With a pandemic, if you allow the virus to continue breeding in meaningful amounts, you’ve got big problems. If you let the disease kind of run its course through a large part of the population, and there’s this churning aspect of many, many people carrying the virus and allowing it to breed and mutate, then just by selective pressure, the virus is developing new generations that can potentially survive the vaccine. We are running a giant experiment. Some epidemiologists will say that if you wanted to design a super-virus, you’d do exactly what we’re doing right now – you’d vaccinate half the population to apply the selective pressure, and then otherwise let the thing keep growing and mutating so it learns to avoid the vaccine.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: What do you say to the pervasive view that delta is really just a problem for the unvaccinated, or for people in red states. Is that accurate?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: The new delta variant really changes the equation. Two things are coming into play simultaneously. The vaccines were designed to target the original Wuhan strain from over a year ago, and they don’t work as well against delta. Although we have high vaccine efficacy for hospitalization and mortality, and this is very good news, the vaccine efficacy for catching the virus and carrying it and retransmitting is not as good, like 80%. In fact, Israel claims it’s as low as 60% for their mix of vaccines.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: So even if we live in a blue state with large vaccinated populations, we still have a problem because delta is still spreading and getting a chance to mutate into possibly even more dangerous variants?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Right. And there’s also the problem of long-haul Covid, which you can get even if you are vaccinated and have a breakthrough case. Even if your case was asymptomatic.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: A lot of people still seem dismissive of long-haul Covid, even though recent reports say that </strong><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/covid-19-exposed-our-inequities-long-covid-may-exacerbate-them\"><strong>one in four Americans</strong></a><strong> who contract the coronavirus get long-haul symptoms, like shortness of breath, debilitating fatigue, brain fog, and memory loss. Keeping in mind that the delta variant is still relatively new, so much remains to be seen about its long-term health effects, what do we know so far?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Fortunately, we’ve got data from the U.K., which is much better than anything we’ve generated in the U.S. The challenge in the U.S. is that we’ve failed to get a large-scale testing program that tests everyone regardless of whether they volunteer, have symptoms, or not. The data that we have from the U.K. includes everyone. It’s a good random sample of the population of people that have Covid and know it, those that have Covid and don’t know it, and the people that don’t have Covid but might have other health issues.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In the U.K. there has been amazing statistical analysis of that data, which show a couple of really important things that are very different from what the sparse data that we have in the U.S. show. In the U.S., you see these tweets from physicians that say that fewer than 1% of the population shows any long-haul Covid issues. Well, the problem is that people are not being identified as having long Covid issues because they aren’t being tested -- so they don’t understand that the issues they are having are related to Covid. But in the U.K., where they’ve done these massive surveys with hundreds of thousands of people, they actually can show that yes, long-haul Covid is a serious issue, and not just for the unvaccinated. It’s affecting everyone. Anyone who has the disease, whether they have symptoms or not, actually has a reasonably high likelihood of having one of the symptoms that persists long after the infection.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: So just to be clear, even if I’m vaccinated and my infection was asymptomatic, I could end up with problems that last for months if not longer?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: That’s correct. The challenge is that these issues are so hard to identify. When you get Covid, it attacks the ACE2 receptor, which happens to be all over your body. So when you get a Covid infection, it could establish itself anywhere – your brain, your lungs, your intestines, your stomach, your joints, your muscles, and depending on where it really takes hold in different peoples’ bodies, you can have a vast array of different symptoms that are a result of the damage that the virus does to that part of your body. The effects can be muscle pain, indigestion, brain fog, cognitive difficulties, muscle spasms, all kinds of things that we now know are due to Covid. And it’s only when you do these broad survey questions that you can catch them and realize, oh, your muscle pain isn’t because you’ve been playing football, it’s actually because you had Covid.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: What concerns you the most with long-haul Covid?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Unfortunately, we have to deflate the false sense of security that we’re going a good job with the pandemic and we are protecting people who are vulnerable. Right now, we don’t have the proper measures in place. The real menace is the people who are promoting “just learn to live with it” policies and really turning our children into an experiment for a systemic disease that we know does serious damage and can have effects that last a long time.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>We’re gathering more and more data, and it’s most painful for me to see it in the children. In places like the U.K., Canada, and Florida, unvaccinated children are being sent to school with poor abatement protections. In Florida, something like 7,000 children contracted the disease within the last four days last week. That means that there are going to be 700 or so of them that have long-haul Covid symptoms that could keep them out of school for months. And keep in mind that with delta, you can get Covid even if you’ve been vaccinated. You can still have massive viral loads and you can still have long-haul Covid.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: And yet we still have people out there saying that Covid is just like another flu. How does the delta variant compare to the flu?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: At a stretch, you might have been able to compare the flu to the Wuhan variant, but delta is so much worse. It has a thousand times the viral load and twice the ramp-up speed – meaning that when you contract the virus, you become infectious to others much more quickly than you do with the older variant. Delta has higher mortality and morbidity. We need more data on long-haul Covid with delta, as you say, because it hasn’t been around long enough. But anyone who says that delta is not a long-haul Covid threat is fantasizing, I’m afraid. You take something that is as transmissible as chickenpox, where you can expect one infected person to infect between seven and nine other people, something more than ten times deadlier and nine times more infectious than the earlier strains -- it’s a big deal.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: Why do you say that vaccines alone can’t stop the pandemic? What else do we need?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: For you personally, vaccines offer strong protection from delta for both hospitalization or death, but as we’ve just discussed, you may not have protection from long-haul Covid. And in terms of getting the virus and passing it on, the effectiveness is not so good. It’s important to understand that the vaccines were very good and effective to start, it’s just that they were targeting an older variant. We’ve been too slow on vaccine distribution and we’ve got too many antivax influencers. We just haven’t vaccinated enough people. The combination of not getting to a decent vaccination threshold and having the vaccine efficacy drop as the new variants emerge means that right now we’re not going to get enough suppressive effects of the vaccine alone to slow and stop the transmission.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: Let’s talk about herd immunity. There seem to be more and more scientists saying that we may have trouble getting to herd immunity with delta. What’s your take?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Well, we never got to herd immunity with polio or smallpox. We had to learn how to eradicate them with aggressive and universal vaccine campaigns. I do think that herd immunity is similarly possible to achieve with Covid and that there are nations that are going to do a decent job of it. But they require a few things to happen. The vaccines need to be administered quickly enough that you vaccinate enough people to suppress the virus before it has a chance to mutate out from under that vaccine’s protection. To really suppress the virus quickly, you need to use additional means so that it stops mutating into new variants. The whole effort of designing the vaccine, having it approved by the regulatory bodies, distributing it, and getting the population to start taking it -- that all has to be faster than what we’re doing. It turns out that the speed of response against these viruses is really critical. I think many people don’t fully understand how high the immunity threshold needs to be when you have a virus that’s so infectious.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Scientists talk about something called the R number. The R number is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. R really tells you how many people you expect an infected person to infect. When R starts somewhere between 7 and 9, as it has for this delta variant, we need to be having about 95 to 97% of the population immune in order to achieve herd immunity. Once you’ve been vaccinated, you have pretty good immunity for the first six months, but then it starts to drop at about 3% per month. The longer you wait to kill the new variants, the less you’re protected from the last time you had it. We have this problem of declining efficacy both in having it and being vaccinated. That’s why the CDC is now talking about giving everyone boosters.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: So herd immunity is a race.</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: That’s exactly right. What makes it particularly hard is that these waves of the new variant come and go exponentially. The problem with our vaccine responses is that they’re linear. I can add a fixed number of new hospital beds. I can ship a fixed number of new masks. But the delta variant is doubling every ten days. When the prevalence is limited, you can mount a good response early. You can ship the masks, have the mandates, and distribute the vaccine, but once you’ve got a reasonable spread and exponential growth really kicks in, everything becomes a real struggle.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: What tools do policymakers need?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: There’s a whole set of states that need to apply science-based policy to combat the virus rather than just letting it go. The truth is that they will inevitably learn to do so when it gets bad enough, because if you don’t stop the exponential spread, eventually your hospitals will be overwhelmed. Sadly we’re seeing that now in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and many more states are on track to do the same. So this narrative that it’s a red state pandemic is not true. Cases are growing in 48 states and are on their way to overwhelming their hospitals – Republican and Democratic-led states alike.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>We need to realize that when we haven’t vaccinated enough people and we’ve waited too long, where the vaccines are less effective than they could have been on the older strains, the vaccines alone are not going to be enough on their own to slow this disease. We have to reinstitute abatement measures on a national scale. That means masking, distancing, limits on capacity in bars and restaurants, and large-scale surveillance testing. Doing those things in combination with the vaccines, we could actually slow the thing down. But trying to rely on the vaccine alone or, even worse, avoiding the vaccine, means that the virus is going to continue breeding new variants that get more contagious and more infectious.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: Do you see more lockdowns in our future?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: I empathize with people who say that we don’t want to have a lockdown. I don’t want to be in a lockdown, either. But there are things you have to do if you want to avoid it. You’ve got to stop the exponential growth by other means.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The most important policy tool in that regard is fast action. You’ll see the difference between California and New York, for example. Though they waited longer than I would’ve liked, they acted in the first four to five weeks of the exponential growth of delta. Other states have waited until the pandemic has gotten as bad or worse than it ever was before to take any extra action. Then you have some states, like Florida and the Texas governor, who are actually preventing other measures. These people who say they want to avoid masks and social distancing mandates, and they aren’t going to do a lockdown, well, they’re guaranteeing that they’re going to have to do lockdowns because they’re not addressing the virus early enough where milder measures could have prevented a more severe situation with hospitals being overrun.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: Is it fair to say that the anti-vaxxers and Covid-deniers, despite their rhetoric about not wanting to be vaccine guinea pigs and their vociferous objection to lockdowns, are actually turning us, particularly our children, into guinea pigs for this mutating virus and creating the conditions for lockdowns?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Yes, it is. We have a few really important challenges in the U.S., but there’s a lesson that’s going to sink in at some point: the idea of divide and conquer. That means when you get an area clean, you keep it clean. And that means border controls. We haven’t really had border controls between the states until this pandemic. The CDC just added France to the “Do Not Travel” list for U.S. travelers due to Covid. Well, guess what? It’s worse in Florida than in France. It’s worse in Texas. It’s worse in Louisiana. Probably in 15 or 20 states already. So shouldn’t the CDC add the “Do Not Travel” recommendations to those states?
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: How do you enforce that?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: It is difficult to enforce, but at least you could slow things down, preventing planes and trains from coming in, and so on. But it’s pretty clear that some states are going to continue sustaining the virus while others continue to try to fight it. Some are fighting it effectively and others aren’t. Just watch over the next couple of weeks the difference between Louisiana, Texas, and Florida, and New York and California. The surges in the faster-acting states will be shorter and cost less. The others will take longer to deal with, cost more, and kill more people.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: Between vaccines alone not being enough to halt the spread of the virus and Long-haul COVID, what does this mean for all the schools that are rushing to open for in-person instruction, some with no vaccine or mask mandates at all?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Remember what happened last year, when the schools rushed to open without the proper mitigation measures in place for the Wuhan strain. Those schools that made the attempt when the virus was even at moderate local prevalence immediately had outbreaks in the school and accelerated the growth of the virus in their communities. When the exponential growth wouldn’t abate on its own, they had to shut down in-person instruction and go virtual.
</p>
<p>
Before they had the vaccines, those schools that were successful in remaining open used masks, distancing, and improved ventilation along with regular surveillance testing to keep the virus out of the schools and minimize the number and duration of outbreaks.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>But now, the stats and risks with delta are much worse. So much so, that students are in a worse situation now, even with about 50% of the U.S. vaccinated, than they were with Wuhan last year. With the delta variant and no abatement whatsoever, an infected student or teacher would, on average, infect nine other people! 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Even if your school community was vaccinated at the average U.S. rate of about 50% with a 60% vaccine efficiency versus sickness and retransmission, that just means that an infected person would infect at least five other people instead of nine, and the virus will continue to grow exponentially.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The good news is that if you throw in regular surveillance tests, masks, and improved ventilation and HEPPA filters, you can take the number all the way below one and suppress the virus. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Schools essentially need a multi-layered defense strategy or risk mass outbreaks worse than in 2020. Sadly, early reports from the first partial weeks of school are already sounding dire, especially in those states eschewing any meaningful measures. One Tampa, Florida district reported 5,599 students and 316 staff quarantined after the first four days of school.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: What can parents do?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Enough of the states are having problems that it really doesn’t matter where you are at this point. The number one thing is to get kids double vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines. With the younger ones, take them the moment the vaccine is approved for them. And keep in mind that because vaccines are not an ultimate protection as they once were, look for a school that is going to take abatement measures seriously and recognize the fact that asymptomatic people can spread the virus and that having a vaccine doesn’t prevent you from spreading it.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Besides the masks and the distancing, the schools really have to have proper ventilation, filtering, and air exchanges. We know that the virus is airborne and that the primary path to infection is through aerosolized droplets. We’d like to see much more attention and understanding from the CDC, OSHA, and anyone who writes policy for the schools, that the virus behaves like cigarette smoke. It’s not really about droplets or contracting the virus through contact. If you’re indoors and the windows are closed, six feet and masking won’t work. The room gets filled with the virus. Plexiglass can even trap the virus and increase your chance of getting it! You want the air exchanged rapidly and you want particle filtration that will use a HEPA filter to capture the virus particles.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are easy ways to test how well you’re doing. You can get a $200 CO2 meter which you can place in a room and track how much CO2 is gathering. That’s a measure of how much air has been exhaled by other people. If the CO2 level goes up, your risk goes up. This is very low cost. Any school can afford a gadget to take through the classes through the course of the day and measure how they’re doing.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Bottom line, if you don’t feel like the school is protecting your children, find another school or keep them at home.
</p>

<p><strong>LP: Your company has been working on low-cost, high-sensitivity Covid tests. If the delta variant ramps up faster in the body, becoming infectious to other people more quickly, does it mean we need more than the once-a-week testing that has become common in schools and workplaces?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: Once a week is the bare minimum of what you could do for the Wuhan strain. That’s when the virus took four days to ramp up to infectiousness in your body. Now, with the faster-acting virus, you need to be tested two or three times a week. Ideally, you would have a three-times-a-week test with very high sensitivity to detect the virus as early as possible. You have very little time to detect it before people start spreading it. You need to catch it when the virus is still at a low concentration in the body. Unfortunately, a lot of the rapid tests and antigen tests in use now are not that sensitive, in which case you really need to do daily testing.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>LP: Is there some good news to leave us with?</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PA: The good news is that the new mRNA vaccines really are scientific wonders and are the single most powerful protection anyone can muster. So go get that and feel 80 times safer from death or hospitalization. Also know that we’ve seen places like New Zealand, Germany, and Singapore manage to get delta under control with diligence in applying new measures in addition to the vaccines. They instituted strong mask policies, distancing, capacity limits, and so on. This is doable. We should absolutely be able to do it ourselves if we can get ourselves a little more science-aligned and a little more unified and cooperative in battling the virus instead of each other.

                                    <p>The fall of Kabul on Sunday 15 August was the culmination of an unexpected offensive by the Taliban, in which they had seized most districts and all major cities &mdash; along with Afghanistan's main border crossings. The rapid progression was in part due to coordinated peace agreements which were struck with local leaders, while Afghan troops exchanged U.S. vehicles and weapons for safe passage.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The swift collapse came as a shock to most observers. Just two days earlier, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/13/afghanistan-taliban-pentagon-deeply-concerned\">Pentagon had claimed</a> Kabul was “not right now in an imminent threat environment”. Two weeks earlier, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/afghan-government-could-collapse-six-months-after-u-s-withdrawal-new-intelligence-assessment-says-11624466743\">Pentagon’s assessment</a> was that Kabul could fall within six months. When, just a month earlier, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/08/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-drawdown-of-u-s-forces-in-afghanistan/\">a journalist asked Joe Biden</a> whether he saw any parallels with the end of the Vietnam war, his answer was: “None whatsoever. Zero.” The President added that the Taliban were not “remotely comparable in terms of capability” to the North Vietnamese Army.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>It seems that even the grimmest predictions got the real balance of power between the Taliban and the Afghan government wrong. What explains the systematic underestimation of the Taliban’s capabilities? Our <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/how-not-disengage-conflict-evidence-afghanistan\">research</a> on NATO’s withdrawal from combat operations in Afghanistan suggests the Taliban have been strategic in their use of violence, using restraint to influence military assessments of their capabilities in order to encourage more rapid withdrawals. The recent events in Afghanistan offer a replay of this strategy, at an even bigger scale and to dramatic effect.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how we did our research</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20200412\">article</a>, we study the large-scale security transition from international troops to local government forces in Afghanistan, between 2011 and 2014. This transition consisted of two distinct phases. The first phase of withdrawal included transferring military authority to local forces. The second phase involved the physical departure of international troops, as the number of foreign forces decreased from 140,000 to 12,000, along with the closure, retrograde, or transfer of nearly 800 military bases.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Our study used exceptionally granular geo-tagged and time-stamped data on different types of insurgent and security operations &mdash; we used data collected since the start of NATO activity in Afghanistan in 2001. This data is otherwise known as SIGACTS and has been used widely to study combat operations in <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170416\">Afghanistan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/661983?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\">Iraq</a>. We combined the data with survey records of 370,000 civilians gathered between 2008 and 2016 (called <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/06/how-to-make-surveys-in-war-zones-better-and-why-this-is-important/\">ANQAR</a>), which detail perceptions of security transitions, perceptions of territorial control, and the extent of local security provision. Our article provides further details on the methodology we used. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In our analysis, we estimate the impact of each phase of the transition on measures of conflict intensity. First, we identify the impact of the transfer of control from foreign troops (ISAF) to Afghan forces (ANSF). As the transition process was completed in five tranches, we are able to exploit the temporal variation generated by the transition process. Panel A of Figure 1 shows the territorial distribution of conflict intensity and Panel B shows the assignment of Afghan districts to one of the five transition tranches.
</p>
                          <p>Comparing districts in which the security transition has been implemented to other districts, before and after the transition, we find that the security transition was associated with both decreases in actual violence outcomes and increases in perception of security as reported by the SIGACTS and ANQAR survey data respectively. Figure 2 depicts the drop in various violence outcomes once security responsibility had been formally handed over to ANSF.
</p>
                          <p>Next, we turn to gauge the effect of physical withdrawal of NATO troops on the security levels. The closure of bases was more haphazard, and also less well documented. To study this second phase, we leveraged a simple but important fact about the timing of physical exit: the geographic location of bases &mdash; their distance to military air hubs used to transport supplies out of Afghanistan &mdash; partially determined when bases were shut down. We use these logistical constraints to estimate the causal impact of the physical withdrawal of troops. Panel A of Figure 3 demonstrates the variation of timing of the base closure dates relative to the transition onset announcements. Panel B of Figure 3 shows the least-cost, shortest distance from a district centroid to the nearest logistic hub mapping well into the timing of base closure. We find that the physical withdrawal and base closure is associated with a drastic worsening of the conflict situation with both violence and security perceptions worsening drastically. We also confirm that our results are not driven by displacement effects between districts.
</p>
                          <p>What explains the initial drop in violence in the first phase of the transition, and its subsequent rise in the second phase? We do not find evidence suggesting that the withdrawal announcement weakened the ability of the Taliban to mobilize; similarly, we do not find evidence suggesting that the ANSF ability improves with the handover. Rather, we argue that the mechanism that could account for our findings is a strategic decision by the Taliban to scale back violence during the transition period. Local security transfers created an “overwatch” period, in which the relative capacity of the Taliban and the ANSF was signaled to ISAF forces. As such, the Taliban had an incentive to understate its capacity in a manner that was both difficult to detect, and that confirmed NATO forces’ biases (i.e., that Afghan security forces were ably trained and capable of delivering security on their own). In our article, we formalize this logic in a simple game in which violence serves as a signal about the relative capacities of the Taliban and the ANSF.
</p>
<p>The Taliban’s strategy during the 2011-2014 transition facilitated the withdrawal, by giving a false impression of the capabilities of local actors to take on the security challenges of fighting alone. The Afghanistan Papers, released by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/\">Washington Post</a> in 2019, give us an opportunity to explore these decisions through internal assessments. SIGAR, reflecting on these exit interviews, came to the conclusion that various military benchmarks had failed to correctly measure the capabilities of local Afghan forces, masking their fundamental weaknesses. In the end, these forces were “<a href=\"https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/lessonslearned/sigar-17-62-ll.pdf\">ill-prepared to deal with deteriorating security after the drawdown of U.S. combat forces.”</a>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Of course, a wide range of factors contributed to the implosion of the Afghan government in recent days. But, our research brings to light two elements that are crucial. First of all, our study underlines that the Taliban’s surge to power started in 2014. Following the withdrawal of NATO troops from (most) combat operations, the Taliban stepped up its offensive and gained effective control over large swathes of rural Afghanistan. This is the context in which President Trump negotiated the definitive US exit from Afghanistan – an agreement that President Biden followed when he committed to withdrawing all troops by August 31, 2021. Constructing historical counterfactuals comes with obvious caveats, but it is possible that a correct assessment of the Taliban’s capacity during the 2011-2014 transition could have informed a different withdrawal strategy and could have thwarted the rise of the Taliban we have seen since 2014.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The second reason why our research is relevant is that the Taliban’s strategic restraint strategy was not new. Military planners and policymakers should have learned from the first transition not to underestimate the Taliban. In 2011-2014, the Taliban stepped up its offensive in rural areas only after major bases were closed. The same happened in the last few weeks. The movement’s swift conquest of provincial capitals and border crossings followed the <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/o.vandeneynde/Downloads/npr.org/2021/07/02/1012680801/u-s-military-has-withdrawn-from-largest-base-in-afghanistan-handed-over-control%3ft=1629276017284\">hand-over of the largest base</a> and logistical hub of the US mission, Bagram airport, on July 2, 2021. At that point, the US had effectively deconstructed its military capabilities in the country. The Taliban could then start an offensive that would quickly reveal its full military and political strength, leading to the fall of Kabul.

                                    <p>As the super-contagious Delta variant of Covid rips across the country, in no small part due to the behavior of the millions of Americans who have so far chosen to remain unvaccinated, the question of whether to make jabs mandatory is becoming urgent. A lot of libertarians are still voicing opposition. What gives?
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>An expanding list of employers, universities, and businesses are now requiring vaccines and stipulating that those who remain unvaccinated undergo testing and other protocols, such as masking. As many as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-joe-biden-business-health-travel-a1670ffa08f1f2eab42c675d99f1d9ad\">seven million federal workers</a> have to show proof of vaccination or be tested weekly and wear masks. Defense Secretary Austin is indicating that will soon hold for the armed forces and military employees. North Carolina, New York, and California are asking the same of their state employees.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>As of August 9, United Airlines, Tyson Foods, and Microsoft have mandated vaccines for workers, as have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/health/us-hospitals-demand-workers-vaccinated-partner/index.html\">1,500 health systems</a>. The second <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-teachers-union-shifts-stance-back-vaccine-mandate-covid-surges-2021-08-08/\">largest U.S. teachers’ union</a> has also indicated that all teachers should be vaccinated to protect children. If you’re a student wanting to attend classes in-person this fall, you’ll need to roll up your sleeve and get vaccinated at over 500 colleges and universities, including several large state systems.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On August 3, New York City became the first big city in the country to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nyc-require-proof-vaccination-indoor-activities-mayor-2021-08-03/\">require proof of vaccination at restaurants, gyms, and other businesses</a> – though the verification system has proven buggy and easy to manipulate.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>All this has many libertarians in a tizzy.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Libertarians, known for their free-market ideology and promotion of an idiosyncratic concept of individual liberty, are split badly on the issues. Some, especially in academia, are unwilling to ride on theoretical magic carpets that don’t go very far in the real world when it comes to Covid. This group supports mandatory vaccines, admitting that it’s not really okay to infringe upon the freedom of others to remain alive and healthy. But many, especially the activist anti-vaxxers and their enablers in the political sphere, argue vociferously against vaccine requirements no matter what the consequences to others. Even if that consequence is death.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>These zealots shout: “My body, my decision!” But when it comes to your body and your risks, apparently that’s your problem. People like babies and kids, vulnerable to Covid because they aren’t eligible for vaccines (currently <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kids-sick-covid-are-filling-children-s-hospitals-areas-seeing-n1276238\">filling up children’s hospitals in many parts of the country</a>), and the immunocompromised, which includes cancer patients, people with diabetes, and pregnant women, are supposed to take all risks of exposure on the chin, including those created by recalcitrant caregivers. At hospitals still without mandates, a person undergoing chemotherapy is expected to accept being surrounded by unvaccinated medical workers whose choices put them in constant mortal danger.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican, just signed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-bills-immunizations-8bd5cccfc3558d761bb59643ee2c6761\">one of the “medical freedom” bills currently circulating</a>, which grandly asserts that people have a “natural, essential and inherent right to bodily integrity, free from any threat or compulsion by government to accept an immunization.” Tellingly, it doesn’t address state laws compelling children to receive various vaccines in order to attend school. That’s because the citizens of New Hampshire are unwilling to let deadly diseases like measles and polio tear through their classrooms and disable or kill their kids. Some states allow controversial exceptions to this mandate, such as religious objections, but you don’t get out of the requirement by making speeches about bodily integrity.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Americans have all kinds of awesome rights as individuals. In the majority of cases, you get to decide what risks to take with your own life and property. If you’d like to win the Darwin Award and <a href=\"https://mpora.com/multi-sport/there-are-hundreds-of-stupid-ways-to-die-but-these-have-got-to-be-some-of-the-silliest/\">try to jet ski off Niagra Falls</a>, you can do that.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>But you aren’t free to subject others to deadly harm. You’re not allowed to drive your Corvette at 100 mph and spin donuts on the freeway, because you might hurt somebody. You don’t get to fire your AK 47 into the air at a Fourth of July picnic. And you won’t be lighting up a Marlboro on an airplane. Your personal liberty, in such cases, is curtailed in order to ensure the safety of others.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>You may not like it, but the Supreme Court has supported intrusions on your body in a number of cases in the name of public and individual safety. These include things like blood alcohol testing and strip and body cavity searches. If you are having a psychotic breakdown and you are a criminal defendant, the state can <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0617/p01s01-usju.html\">force you to take medication to make you competent to stand trial</a>. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>For quite some time, American law has been clear that the bodily intrusion of mandatory vaccinations is necessary in order to shield citizens from harm.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In 1905, in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/\">Jacobson v. Massachusetts</a>, the Supreme Court explained that people living in a civil society have obligations to protect one another from dangerous diseases: “In every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members, the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In that particular case, Cambridge pastor Henning Jacobson had argued that he and his kids had experienced a bad reaction to prior vaccines and so should be given an exemption, but the Court said that he had no proof and would not be getting a pass. As a citizen and a parent, he wasn’t permitted to expose anyone, including his own kid or anybody else’s, to smallpox, which was raging at the time. The Court sent the message that your individual liberty is never absolute and can be subject to the police power of the state.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>There is a teeny tiny risk in taking a vaccine for a disease like Covid, though it is far less of a risk than contracting the disease itself. But there are vastly more risky things a citizen can be required to do for what is determined to be the greater good.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Take national defense. Libertarians get uncomfortable on this subject, and many like to pretend that you can rely on volunteers to get the job done. Reality check: Though it’s been almost a half-century since Americans were drafted into military service, the fact is that conscription has been necessary for every major war. Yes, it’s often possible to find enough people to volunteer for military service during peacetime, at least if you pay them, but people are generally unenthusiastic about getting maimed or killed during wartime.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>During the U.S. Civil War, trying to get anyone to fight was a nightmare. Wealthy people were paying poor people to be cannon fodder in their place. In 1863, New York City erupted in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots\">4-day deadly riot</a> because people opposed the Civil War draft law which allowed rich men like J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie to pay off substitutes. That racially charged riot, which saw whites attacking blacks throughout the city, was one of the bloodiest in U.S. history. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Certainly, you can argue that the U.S. conscription system is sexist and arbitrary because it only pertains to young men. But the fact is, when American men turn 18, the federal government requires them to register for the Selective Service. Doing so is a prerequisite for things like obtaining student loans or being hired for a federal job, and 41 states make it part of getting a driver’s license. Failure to register is a felony offense.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In a <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/245/366.html\">1918 opinion</a>, the Supreme Court equated Congress’s constitutional power to “raise and support armies” with the authority to force citizens into service.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The government <a href=\"https://www.sss.gov/register/benefits-and-penalties/\">appeals to fairness in stating why registration is necessary</a>: “Selective Service’s mission is to register virtually all men residing in the United States. If a draft is ever needed, the process must be fair, and that fairness depends on having all eligible men register. In the event of a draft, for every man who fails to register, another man would be required to take his place in service to his country.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Recently, Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who presumably has registered for Selective Service, decided to refuse to be vaccinated for Covid. He states that he is willing <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/kirk-cousins-would-rather-surround-himself-with-plexiglas-than-get-the-covid-19-vaccine-211958822.html\">surround himself with plexiglass</a> in the team's quarterback room in order to avoid getting jabbed. Unfortunately, there’s <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200908/can-plexiglass-stop-covid\">not much evidence that plexiglass barriers prevent the spread of Covid</a>, because the aerosol particles move through the air like cigarette smoke. Therein lies the problem. There’s really no way to seal yourself off from your fellow citizens unless you live alone in quarantine. And the frequency of asymptomatic transmission means you can’t tell whether many people near you have the disease or not.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Even when the unvaccinated receive weekly testing, it’s still not enough to protect other people, because the virus spreads exponentially, which means that it proliferates in much shorter periods of time. This is particularly concerning in medical facilities, where testing unvaccinated workers once a week risks exposing immunocompromised people to life-threatening conditions. The same goes for nursing homes.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The issue of twice-a-week testing opens yet another can of libertarian worms. Who is expected to pay the hundreds of dollars a week that multiple tests of the unvaccinated will cost in the case, say, of government workers or state university students? The taxpayers? Oh really? Among some libertarians, taxation is regarded as theft. Would they agree that the cancer patient can be taxed to support the constant testing of medical workers whose behavior threatens her life? Let’s ask <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/10/cruz-paul-mandates-mask-vaccine/\">Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul about that</a>.</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>According to Larry Brilliant, a prominent epidemiologist and part of the WHO team that helped eradicate smallpox, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/09/covid-epidemiologist-larry-brilliant-on-delta-variant-vaccinations.html\">the Covid pandemic is nowhere near over</a>, and the Delta variant may be “the most contagious virus ever seen.” He believes that the likelihood of more variants arising due to lack of vaccinations is high, and there is even a possibility of a “super variant” emerging that vaccines don’t work against. This possibility is currently low, he explains, but we must do everything possible to prevent it now. That means jabs for the unvaccinated ASAP.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill, a philosopher oft cited by libertarians, wrote in 1859 about the “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062758/\">harm principle</a>,” which holds that the state can restrict the actions of individuals to prevent harm to others: “The liberty of the individual must be . . . limited: he must not make himself a nuisance to other people . . . the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant, and . . . in the part, which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Clearly, people electing to remain unvaccinated are violating Mill’s harm principle.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Committing suicide by virus is one thing, but inflicting mortal harm on others is another. If libertarians wish to maintain their self-centered fixation on their own freedoms without considering how their behavior injures others, let them do so -- in indefinite quarantine from the rest of us.

                                    <p>Midway through 2021, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man, realized the first part of his dream to transcend earthly constraints in a thrilling rocket ride to space.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration <a href=\"https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/07/28/jeff-bezos-space-qualified-astronaut/\">noted tartly that he could not claim the title of astronaut</a>, because that term is reserved for persons whose activities in orbit were, among other things, beneficial to public safety. But Bezos has a much bigger vision than that. He wants to be the savior of humankind.</p>
<p>In November 2019, the<em> Atlantic Monthly</em> ran a cover story, “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/what-jeff-bezos-wants/598363/\">Jeff Bezos’s Master Plan</a>,” featuring an image of the tycoon’s bald head as a glowing planet encircled by a halo of rings, which explains why the billionaire’s recent trip was more than a pricey joyride. The piece outlines Bezos’s conviction that in order to save the planet, humans must leave the Earth behind to colonize outer space. The CEO seeks to realize this plan through his space travel company, Blue Origin. In the future, according to Bezos, humans will escape the ravages of energy depletion and environmental catastrophe by living in meticulously crafted cylindrical space tubes with perfectly controlled climates. </p>
<p>Bezos’s Silicon Valley colleagues vary in their approach to solving earthly problems like climate change and inequality, but there is growing agreement that sticking around is not an option. Fellow tech entrepreneur and space enthusiast Elon Musk, for his part, favors colonizing Mars. </p>
<p>In the fever dreams of Silicon Valley, Planet Earth fades in significance. It becomes little more than a mere jumping-off point to the vast universe beyond where environmental constraints and human foibles need no longer apply. Science and technological advance directed by fantastically wealthy, anti-democratically inclined businessmen will override the limitations of our human nature, and nature itself, once and for all. The final conquest.</p>
<p>If this sounds like a delusion, that’s because it is. But if we are to avoid a march towards a very bleak future, it helps to understand the source of the fantasy. Fortunately, feminist thinkers have been on the case for decades. Their work strongly suggests that before we don our spacesuits, we had better first revise our assumptions and approach to living right here on Earth. Otherwise, we will just carry into space the very same pathologies that threatened our earthly survival in the first place.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Valerie Plumwood and Plato’s error</strong>
</p>
<p>Feminists have been exploring the link between human culture and the environmental crisis at least since the 1960s, a time of social and economic upheaval as well as an apocalyptic sense of human-driven threats to survival. By the 1980s, the new field of “ecofeminism” had bloomed, its proponents sharing a central premise that the destruction of the environment and imbalances in human society are not only linked, but mutually reinforcing. Ecofeminists emphasized that a habit of viewing both nature and women as belonging to devalued spheres is a major culprit in environmental crises.</p>
<p>This burst of investigative energy was followed by a severe backlash. Charges – some of them misleading -- of essentialism, ethnocentrism, and the recreation of damaging paradigms that many feminists had tried to undo became so pervasive that by 2010, the diverse movement was routinely dismissed. But this wholesale rejection led to the dismissal of much valuable work that could help inform current thinking. </p>
<p>Case in point: Valerie Plumwood’s <em>Feminism and the Mastery of Nature, </em>published in 1993<em>. </em>This illuminating work details how western rationality evolved with a blind spot, namely, a refusal to acknowledge human dependency on nature which was accompanied by a tendency to degrade the position of women. </p>
<p>Plumwood points the finger at Plato, whose metaphor of cosmology outlined a male-female dualism in which rational masculine form (cosmos) rules over irrational feminine matter (chaos). She notes that his <em>Republic</em> emphasized dualism in the Allegory of the Cave, where “nature within” is rejected in favor of a transcendent cultural identity separated from a lower “feminine realm.” The realm of nature that Plato wants to reject is described as “the primal matrix of being, of the woman and the mother, of the body and the senses, of the whole order of physicality and changeability, and finally of the earth itself.” </p>
<p>Plato turns common sense upside down. He suggests that the lifeless, abstract world of forms gives eternal life, but the living, embodied realm of nature is a tomb. Plumwood sees this assumption as leading to a pathological stance in which the rational self can only develop if we deny the value of life, giving preference to values of war, militarism, and means of production dependent on oppression. And the rational self, of course, is a male subject. </p>
<p>In Plumwood’s view, the implications of the Platonic view, extended in the West through Christian rationality, the Enlightenment, and the rise of capitalism, are both profound and disastrous. Our human identity becomes alienated from nature as we increasingly view ourselves as the external controllers of the natural world. In this scheme, everything and everyone associated with nature loses intrinsic value and becomes the instrument for the master subject’s existence. Ecological factors are reduced to “externalities,” and little account is taken of natural limitations.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take much to see how the assumptions Plumwood describes inform the visions of Silicon Valley elites, who, in addition to their quest to ascend to the heavens, also seek to extend human life indefinitely or, in the words of Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, “solve death.”<a href=\"applewebdata://60475E74-1C9C-456A-A23A-14F83E85D76F#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Their view of the human future is a spaceship blasting off from decaying earthly existence – a movement towards a total break with nature. </p>
<p>Bezos’s space tube is haunted by fear -- the human dread of death coupled with a deep anxiety about a universe in which humans do not have ultimate control. This fear launches with a finger on the self-destruct button, ending either with the death of the other on whom the master subject relies or with the abandonment of mastery and failure to adapt in life-affirming ways.</p>
<p>So here we are, with economies and political systems increasingly driven by reckless, greedy man-children who would rather play at being captain of the Starship Enterprise than tackle earthly problems, starting with their own transformation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Dorothy Dinnerstein and Toxic Gender Arrangements</strong> </p>
<p>The work of feminist psychologist Dorothy Dinnerstein helps explain another way in which our western assumptions and approach to life lead us astray. Her 1976 book, <em>The Mermaid and the Minotaur</em>, takes dualism by the horns, arguing that seemingly “natural” gender arrangements have not only been damaging to human potential but greatly destructive to the environment. Dinnerstein goes back to the earliest human past and looks at the evolutionary and biological background of human social development.
</p>
<p>Dinnerstein traces the dualistic pattern of male-as-transcendent and the female-as-nurturer to models of childrearing in which the care of infants and early childcare is relegated primarily to females. This model, she points out, has its origins in the human evolutionary-biological situation, as it is the mother who gets pregnant and breastfeeds the helpless infant. But patriarchal cultures make gender arrangements determinative where they should not be. Dinnerstein argues that patriarchies leverage aspects of human evolution and biology&mdash;now rendered far less determinative by developments like birth control and reduced infant mortality&mdash;to designate women as primary caregivers and secondary human beings.
</p>
<p>What we end up with is a foundation for patriarchy that disconnects males from processes of caregiving and nurturing, leading not only to a variety of social problems but a hostile stance toward all things classed as feminine -- and to nature itself. Patriarchal cultures breed adults who will revenge themselves on the mother for her early omnipotence and act out upon her surrogate, nature, in increasingly technically proficient expressions of infantile aggression. </p>
<p>Dinnerstein’s warnings play out in trends of privatization and renewed calls for traditional family values which reinstate ancient sexual arrangements and reproduce what is best for the western male subject&mdash;i.e. the affluent white man&mdash;through deregulated markets and hierarchies of power that exclude and subordinate women and non-whites. </p>
<p>The view that pathologies become inscribed into human culture when males do not fully embody nurturing roles helps explain why, despite multiple waves of feminism, gendered household labor remains unpaid, and market activities like childcare and home health care are disproportionately shouldered by women, nonwhites, and immigrants. The role of the family within the American neoliberal context is constructed to reaffirm unhealthy patriarchal family norms. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the full participation of women in all aspects of society has not been achieved. Despite the fact that families rely on the income of both parents and require their caregiving investments, American workplaces remain hostile to parental leave in general, and paternal childcare in particular. Men are still commonly considered less naturally equipped to care for young children, even though the rise of stay-at-home dads, who have doubled in number since 1989, proves that men have plenty of caregiving capacity and many feel fulfillment and pride in using it. </p>
<p>Dinnerstein’s work suggests that a child born to see humans of all genders robustly participating in its development has the potential to grow into an adult more sensitive to the conditions under which we exist on the earth, better able to recognize and accommodate denied relationships of dependency and mutuality, and more likely to acknowledge our debt to others. It underscores that modifying sexual arrangements is necessary for creating an egalitarian culture beyond dualism and to finding a mutual, ethical basis for an enriching coexistence with others -- and with the Earth itself. </p>
<p>Plumwood and Dinnerstein’s inquiries into the illusions of mastery reveal the conditions that keep us from mastering ourselves and allow us to become seduced by fantasies of escape from reality that may actually hasten our demise. And they help explain why legal, institutional, economic barriers –and especially mental and psychological barriers -- are so difficult to surmount. </p>
<p>The good news is that humans are the only creatures we know of that can actually guide our own evolution. If confronted, our mindsets and our social arrangements are mutable. The western subject could potentially embark on a long-overdue homecoming to Earth.

                                    <p>July 30, 2021, marks the twentieth anniversary of the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), and the organization is thrilled to be celebrating two decades of contributing research and expert analysis to global policy making.</p>
<p>CIGI’s initial focus on international relations and the global economy, which led to its role in laying the groundwork for the creation of the G20 Leaders’ Summit, has since evolved to addressing issues at the intersection of technology and global governance: data, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and digital platform regulation.
</p>
<p>In celebration of our anniversary, leading experts and government officials who have been involved with CIGI over the years shared their happy birthday messages. You can watch the messages in two compilations (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pmA1A15Tn88\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Mn-jOE9210c\">Video 2</a>) or view the full-length well-wishes individually in a <a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnfpAiVwGCdC2eefWHz715UpEPShQzV-\">playlist</a> we’ve collected on YouTube.
</p>
<p>Canada’s twenty-third prime minister, the Right Honourable Justin Trudeau, also generously took the time to acknowledge the organization’s twentieth anniversary.</p>

<p><br></p><h4>CIGI: Reflections on Our Twentieth Birthday</h4>
<p>When the Centre for International Governance Innovation &mdash; CIGI &mdash; was created <a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/about/20/\">20 years ago</a>, the world had not flattened, and history had not quite ended. There was a recognition that post-World War II arrangements were fraying, that the world no longer centred on the Western alliance, and that “new” issues like climate change and public health were not served well by the global governance system. The global rules of the game had provided Canada access to every club that mattered (and then some), and underpinned a relatively unknown but highly innovative company founded in a small city in a small country, developing what would become an iconic, world-leading brand called BlackBerry. But the rules were imperfect and incomplete.
</p>
<p>The Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998 brought the term <i>contagion</i>, stolen from the health lexicon, into the global economic discourse. It also demonstrated the importance of adding seats at the discussion table to include rising Asia, for it became apparent that solutions imposed by outsiders alone were no longer tenable, if they ever had been. Thus was born the Group of Twenty (G20) at the finance ministers and central bank heads level, and the germ of the idea of its elevation to country leaders.
</p>
<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/about/history/\">formative years</a>, CIGI’s principal broad preoccupation was to address gaps in global governance. In pursuing this remit, many topics were covered via a multitude of activities. In keeping with the ethos of a think tank, as much attention was paid &mdash; and still is &mdash; to communication and impact as to the production of sound research. But the concept of a <a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/multimedia/forged-crisis-inside-look-g20s-history/\">G20 at the leaders’ level</a> was the coalescing force that gave the young institution a purpose and an identity.
</p>
<p>When the G20 was finally created in 2008, one would be hard pressed to claim it was because of the work of CIGI and others who had taken to the idea. It was the financial crisis of 2007/8 that galvanized action. But the analysis on key questions around structure, scope and operation had been addressed, at least in theory, and the concept had been socialized in policy circles. By the time the first summit took place, in Washington, DC, in November 2008, the change seemed more evolutionary than revolutionary.
</p>
<p>Arguably, the work of the G20 &mdash; and of CIGI &mdash; has only just begun. Having dealt with the immediate aftermath of that crisis, and an initial burst in long-term thinking through the establishment of the Financial Stability Board (the Forum’s successor), the G20 has been in drift for several years. The lack of a permanent secretariat contributed, as did the inevitable inertia that arrives when a crisis has passed and the roll-up-your-sleeves work of addressing daunting problems of old and new vintage takes over. This drift, coupled with the emergence of a new geo-economics around digital governance, resulted in a stasis that is all too apparent as we deal with the <a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/documents/Strategic_Plan-2020-web-2_1.pdf\">next frontier</a> in global governance &mdash; the norms, processes and institutions required to deal with the data-driven digital era, and transformative technologies more broadly.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the interplay between the urgent and the important in world affairs, consider the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p>
<p>Although we are still in the midst of fighting a first phase of the COVID-19 crisis, it is already clear that its impacts will be manifold and long-lasting. So far, analogies have been drawn with 9/11, the influenza epidemic of a century ago, the financial crisis of 2007/8, and the invention of the internet and the smartphone, as examples of game-changing episodes. No doubt, the current crisis will have some features in common with previous analogues, and some that are unique to it. We are still in the realm of informed speculation. Even so, it is not too early to <a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/global-cooperation-after-covid-19/\">reflect</a> on what the enduring impacts of the crisis will be.
</p>
<p>Even limiting the list to CIGI’s current preoccupations around international cooperation and digital and data governance, there are implications in many dimensions, for:
</p>
<ul><li>faith in public action and in science;
</li><li>the civil liberties-security-privacy trade-off;
</li><li>social cohesion;
</li><li>vaccines, intellectual property and the public good;
</li><li>global cooperation in the shadow of US-China relations with each other and with the rest of the world; and
</li><li>globalization itself.
</li></ul>
<p>Governance is about balances. Balancing the elegance of technically correct solutions (“evidence”) with the expedients of navigating a political process to put them, or some version of them, into effect. Balancing the will of the majority with the rights and interests of minorities. Balancing pure wealth creation with its distribution and with non-material considerations like values. Balancing the short term with the medium term and the long term. Balancing efficiency in decision making with voice and inclusion.
</p>
<p>As CIGI looks ahead to its next 20 years, the issues and context will surely have evolved even further, although the choices involved in designing good, innovative governance will not have changed. It is a fluid constancy that suits CIGI just fine.

                                    <p>The persistent recurrence of speculative excess is a defining feature of financial capitalism wherever and whenever investors have the opportunity to trade assets. For the last 500 years, from tulip bulbs in the 1630s to cryptocurrencies today, the prices of assets have been subject to waves of herding behavior and momentum investing, with prices decoupling from any relationship to past, present and prospective cash flow. The economic historian Charles Kindleberger and the economist Robert Aliber summarized the phenomenon in their book on financial crises:</p>
<p><em>Investors have speculated in commodity exports, commodity imports, agricultural land at home and abroad, urban building sites, railroads, new banks, discount houses, stocks, bonds (both foreign and domestic), glamor stocks, conglomerates, condominiums, shopping centers and office buildings.</em>
</p>
<p>At the extreme, such speculation has come to be characterized as a bubble, a term associated with the iconic South Sea Bubble in London in 1720. As has often been the case, speculation in the shares of the newly chartered South Sea Company began with a plausible story: the opportunity for British merchants to take over the lucrative returns generated by trade with the new world from the fading Spanish Empire. 
</p>
<p>None other than Isaac Newton joined the fray, having transformed himself from the progenitor of mathematical physics in Cambridge to the wealthy master of the Royal Mint. Newton bought in early and cashed out for a healthy profit &mdash; but then as the bubble accelerated he could not stand it and reinvested at the top, shortly to lose everything. He is supposed to have <a href=\"http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">remarked</a>: “I can calculate the motions of the planets, but I cannot calculate the madness of men.”
</p>
<p>Bubbles are ubiquitous. In his history of the city of London since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, David Kynaston chronicles a speculative “bull run” in every decade up to World War I. When New York then emerged as London’s successor, the great bull market of the Roaring Twenties followed. A long generation of “financial repression” followed the Great Depression and World War II, but then came the “money game” years of the 1960s. And stagflation in the 1970s yielded to a generation-long “super-bubble,” as George Soros characterized it, which peaked first with the dot-com bubble of the later 1990s and then in the derivatives-fueled credit bubble that exploded in the global financial crisis of 2007-8. 
</p>
<p>But not all bubbles are the same. When financial speculation is limited to the relatively unleveraged equity markets, the consequences of the inevitable bust are limited. But when speculation is fueled by credit and infects the core banking system, the consequences are likely to be devastating, as in the recession that followed 2008.
</p>
<p>Occasionally, financial speculation fastens on to a transformational general purpose technology (GPT) that has the potential to create a genuinely new economy. Call it a productive bubble. The British railway manias of the 1830s and 1840s &mdash; when the GPT of steam power was applied to locomotion &mdash; were the first fully documented productive bubbles. The railways were built by newly created companies, endowed by Parliament with special privileges: Eminent domain enabled them to take land for their rights of way in return for fair compensation, while limited liability protected investors from losses beyond their actual investment. 
</p>
<h4>“Not all bubbles are the same.” </h4>
<p>First in the 1830s (the “little mania”) and then with substantially greater vigor a decade later (the “great mania”), a doubling of share prices <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1537338\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">induced</a> the mobilization of funding to build out the railway network. When share prices collapsed, many of the promotional ventures became bankrupt, but no one tore up the railways. A financial fiasco left real assets in place, as it did a decade later when London financed a railroad boom in the United States of comparable dimensions.
</p>
<p>In New York, the bull market of the 1920s encompassed massive investment in electricity generation and distribution. Public utility holding companies served as vehicles both for raising needed finance and providing necessary technical expertise. By the time the Great Depression took hold in 1929, installed generating capacity in the U.S. had increased from 13 to 33 million kilowatts.
</p>
<p>Looking back in 1931 on the frenzied investment of 1925-1929, John Maynard Keynes highlighted the productive consequences of unsustainable speculation:
</p>
<p><em>While some part of the investment which was going on in the world at large was doubtless ill-judged and unfruitful, there can, I think, be no doubt that the world was enormously enriched by the constructions of &hellip; 1925 to 1929; its wealth increased in these five years by as much as in any other 10 or 20 years of its history. The expansion centered round building, the electrification of the world and the associated enterprises of roads and motor cars. &hellip; The capacity of the world to produce most of the staple foodstuffs and raw materials was greatly expanded; machinery and new techniques directed by science greatly increased the output of all the metals, rubber, sugar, the chief cereals, etc.</em>
</p>
<p>In our own day, the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s both accelerated the build-out of the physical internet and funded the first wave of quasi-Darwinian exploration of this new economic space in search of commercially relevant and financially sustainable ventures. Of course, as always, proof of the last could only come once the bubble had burst and operating losses could no longer be covered by speculative investment. Amazon survived; pets.com did not.
</p>
<h4>The Unicorn Bubble</h4>
<p>Today, speculation has been reignited in a very different financial regime from any we can observe historically. Since the global financial crisis, risk-free real interest rates have been driven to negative levels and held there by central banks around the world. In response, capital has flowed in large quantities to private, venture-backed new companies at extraordinary valuations &mdash; the “unicorns” &mdash; as well as into an array of innovative digital assets, from cryptocurrencies to non-fungible tokens. 
</p>
<p>As and when the financial regime reverts to historical norms of real returns and terms and credit spreads, much of this investment is likely to prove unproductive: New consumer-oriented digital services that could never find a sustainable revenue model and digital assets of questionable sponsorship and problematic regulatory legitimacy will fade away. 
</p>
<p>During the current wave of speculation, however, it is possible to read the signs of another nascent productive bubble: a green one. The promise is exemplified by Tesla. Bloomberg estimates that, in one form or another, Tesla has raised some $14 billion of risk capital while, over the past three years, its stock price has risen by more than a factor of 10. Pulled along in Tesla’s wake have been a variety of electric vehicle and related ventures. A number of these have secured capital through acquisition by special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs): Since March 2020, $120 billion has been <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/green-spacs-struggle-after-years-of-success-11623922202\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">invested</a> in SPACs that pledged to merge with renewable energy, electric-vehicle and other environmentally sustainable businesses.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, commitment of capital to the sort of blind pools represented by these blank check companies marks the degenerate stage of financial speculation when, literally, anything goes. And so far, a green bubble lacks a critical enabling factor from outside the financial sector: an actively supportive, mission-driven state whose funding is unconstrained by the narrow calculus of cost-benefit analysis. 
</p>
<p>During the current wave of speculation, it is possible to read the signs of another nascent productive bubble: a green one. </p>
<p>In Britain, remember, the promoters of railway ventures gained parliamentary sanction and necessary powers for their speculative ventures based on detailed economic forecasts that only occasionally and often by accident were actually confirmed by results. In the U.S., railroad development was directly subsidized, first at the state and then at the federal level, by grants of public land seized from Native peoples and publicly administered until transferred for private profit.
</p>
<p>Electrification depended upon a very different form of government intervention. The enormous upfront investment required to construct generating stations was accompanied by very low marginal operating costs: the cost of delivering the incremental electron asymptotically approaches zero. Under competitive conditions, with prices driven towards marginal costs, electric utilities would invariably run at a loss. The answer was to restrict competition through establishing electricity providers as regulated public utilities, enjoying local or regional monopolies in exchange for constraints on pricing and rates of return.
</p>
<p>In the decades following World War II, all the components of the digital revolution &mdash; from silicon to software &mdash; were sponsored and accelerated by the U.S. Department of Defense. DOD funded both upstream research and development and served as the first, collaborative customer, pulling the supply side of the sector down the learning curve to low-cost, reliable production. By 1980, venture capital and public equity markets could fund at scale the new ventures that were founded to address the commercial and industrial markets for computers.
</p>
<p>“So far, a green bubble lacks a critical enabling factor from outside the financial sector: an actively supportive, mission-driven state.” </p>
<p>When it comes to climate change, however, up until January, the U.S. federal government has been missing in action. At the margin, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included small gestures toward public investment in response to climate change. But the loan guarantees offered to a handful of startups were not only too narrowly focused, they were also radically misconceived. These companies need procurement contracts, not loan guarantees, to support their development: procurement contracts like those DOD gave to the new semiconductor companies of the 1960s, which were renewable and expandable based on performance. 
</p>
<p>Tesla was able to repay its federally guaranteed loans from the flood of capital Elon Musk attracted. But the battery company A123 and the solar panel company Solyndra subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The embarrassment of the ARRA loan guarantee program became a weapon in the hands of climate deniers and opponents of the Obama administration generally. 
</p>
<p>The Biden administration appears firmly determined to promulgate a green agenda, if not a full-blown Green New Deal. It can look back no more than a year to find a relevant instrument for attracting investment in target technologies, such as novel energy storage systems. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, advanced procurement contracts sped vaccine development at an unprecedented pace, building on prior investments by the National Institutes of Health in the science of mRNA therapeutics.
</p>
<p>Governments cannot summon a productive bubble into existence on command. But by upstream investment in science and enabling technologies, augmented by broad-based, experimental procurement of the fruits of such investment before they are ready for commercial primetime, governments can tee up potentially productive targets for speculative focus. Along with such direct financial commitments, deliberately shifting the regulatory environment to tilt private sector demand in the desired direction is also available. 
</p>
<h4>Monitoring Bubbles</h4>
<p>Correctly reading a bubble in flight is, of course, a problematic exercise. The powers of rationalization among investors who are making money, urged on by charismatic promoters, have proven to be formidable too many times to count. But there is an equivalent of one of those tells that successful poker players look for. The tell of a bubble can be seen when demand curves invert &mdash; that is, when increased price is accompanied by increased demand. 
</p>
<p>When the laws of supply and demand are reversed, trading volume rises with the price of the asset as more investors are sucked into the speculative vortex. Less quantitatively specific signals can be observed as successively less credible ventures draft behind an evident winner, like the variety of electric vehicle companies hoping (in some cases in desperation) to be qualified as “the next Tesla.”
</p>
<p>The parallel challenge is to track the extent to which an asset bubble is supported by leverage. Here the regulators have a primary responsibility. Innovation in finance is constant, and the game between financial entrepreneurs and regulators is neverending. 
</p>
<p>Relatively unleveraged waves of speculation are best left to run themselves out. The longer-term productive benefit of an innovation that attracts speculative attention is by no means always evident at first glimpse. And even if there appears to be no possible productive benefit, killing the speculative impulse at birth does have the potential to create a negative externality: an absence of enthusiastic investor response when a genuine productive bubble could generate social benefits. 
</p>

                                    <p>GEORGE TOWN, Malaysia &mdash; Modern science arose by breaking down complex problems into their parts. As Alvin Toffler, an American writer and futurist, wrote in his 1984 foreword to the chemist Ilya Prigogine’s classic book “Order out of Chaos”: “One of the most highly developed skills in contemporary Western civilization is dissection: the split-up of problems into their smallest possible components. We are good at it. So good, we often forget to put the pieces back together again.” </p>
<p>Specialization produces efficiency in production and output. But one unfortunate result is that silos produce a partial perspective from specialist knowledge; very few take a system-wide view on how the parts are related to the whole. When the parts do not fit or work together, the system may break down. As behavioral economist Daniel Kahnemann put it: “We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.” 
</p>
<p>Silos make group collective action more difficult; nation-states, tribes, communities and groups have different ways of knowing and different repositories of knowledge. A new collective mental map is needed, one that moves away from classical Newtonian science, with its linear and mechanical worldview, toward a systems-view of life. The ecologists Fritjof Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi <a href=\"https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/industrial-agriculture-agroecology-and-climate-change\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">argue</a> that “the major problems of our time &mdash; energy, the environment, climate change, food security, financial security &mdash; cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems, which means that they are all interconnected and interdependent.”
</p>
<p>“Siloed thinking created many of our problems with inequality, injustice and planetary damage.” </p>
<p>A complex, non-linear, systemic view of life sees the whole as a constant interaction between the small and the large: diverse parts that are cooperating and competing at the same time. This organic view of life coincides with the ancient perspective found in numerous cultures &mdash; including Chinese, Indian, native Australian and Amerindian &mdash; that man and nature are one. 
</p>
<p>In short, modern Western science has begun to return to the pre-Enlightenment worldview that saw man, God and Earth in somewhat mystic entanglement. The late Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen argued the world was made up of “open giant complex systems” operating within larger open giant complex systems. Human beings themselves are open giant complex systems &mdash; every brain has billions of neurons connected to each other through trillions of pathways &mdash; continually exchanging and processing information with other humans and the environment. Life is much more complex, dynamic and uncertain than we once assumed. 
</p>
<p>To describe this dynamic, complex and uncertain systemic whole, we need to evolve trans-disciplinary thinking that integrates the natural, social, biological sciences and arts by transcending disciplinary boundaries. Qian concluded that the only way to describe such systemic complexity and uncertainty is to integrate quantitative with qualitative narratives, exactly what the Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller advocates for in “Narrative Economics.”
</p>
<h4>Living Nature</h4>
<p>The idea of the Earth (Gaia) as a living whole that has a delicate balance between biology and the physical environment has long resonated with some ecologists and those close to nature. Recent progress in biological, neural, ecological and information sciences has established the Earth as alive. Humanity has abused the living Earth, and at a basic level, nature is responding. The German historian Philipp Blom, for example, called the 17th-century mini Ice Age “nature’s mutiny,” as if nature can exercise revenge against abuses by humans. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, politicians and economists committed to growth in the short term view nature in a different light. When the 1972 Club of Rome report “The Limits of Growth” was published, political economists mostly ignored it &mdash; they saw nature as an inanimate resource to be exploited in order to build wealth. 
</p>
<p>Since at least World War II, the benchmark measure of economic growth has been gross domestic product (GDP), a flow concept directed toward adding value for human life on the planet without taking into consideration the value destruction of irreplaceable natural capital through resource depletion, biodiversity loss, pollution and other costs that impact human health and well-being. 
</p>
<p>As the Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta lamented in a recent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-report-the-economics-of-biodiversity-the-dasgupta-review\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">report</a> on biodiversity, “Global climate change attracts attention among intellectuals and the reading public not only because it is a grave problem, but perhaps also because it is possible to imagine meeting it by using the familiar economics of commodity taxation, regulation and resource pricing without having to forego growth in material living standards in rich countries. The literature on the economics of climate change has even encouraged the thought that, with only little investment in clean energy sources over the next few years (say 2% of GDP), we can enjoy indefinite growth in the world’s output of final goods and services (global GDP).” 
</p>
<p>This focus on “produced capital” was, until recently, blind to “natural capital,” meaning that biodiversity and non-renewable natural resources like air, water, forests, seas and space that are essential to human well-being were being destroyed at an unprecedented rate, threatening the well-being of humanity as a whole. 
</p>
<h4>One Earth</h4>
<p>What we need is a “One-Earth Balance Sheet” to describe the true and fair accounting for Earth that covers not just the flows and stock of everything, but also natural capital and biodiversity. We do not yet have much of the necessary information to create such a balance sheet, but if we can collectively build it up from all the economic, financial, environmental, social and governance information that is increasingly available, we would slowly construct a new map as the basis for discussing shared goals, challenges and solutions. 
</p>
<p>That was what happened during the Renaissance. European cartographers, navigators, merchants, bankers and scientists drew upon printed maps and knowledge gathered from Arab and Asian sources to slowly improve their maps and technology. There was no top-down design, but rather a collective intellectual and culture “becoming.” New maps led to the discovery of the Americas and new paths to globalization. 
</p>
<p>To map our collective impact on Earth and each other, we need to show how siloed thinking created many of our problems with inequality, injustice and planetary damage. The One-Earth Balance Sheet may help to unveil our blind spots and imbalances. Life is not about partial perspectives of false binaries between good and evil, man and planet, but in recognizing that the many are one. 
</p>
<p>The most basic flaw in economic accounting is statistical stock-flow inconsistency. The United Nations System of National Accounting (SNA) was devised in 1953 to create accounting at the national level through the measurement of flows, such as income, expenditure, imports and exports. Such data is extracted from basic corporate, household, government and financial accounts, each with their accounting and valuation flaws. The SNA has been updated and revised over the years, but it still lacks data, and progress towards global accounting remains slow. 
</p>
<p>Delays in compiling national balance sheets mean that policymakers are often blind to stock imbalances. For example, in the 2008 global financial crisis, bank regulators were shocked to find undisclosed debt hidden in derivatives “below the line” or in off-balance, offshore vehicles. Environmentalists are furious that externalities (unmeasured pollution, environmental deterioration, inequalities) are not measured, resulting in bad policies and predatory business practices. 
</p>
<p>After the 2008 global financial crisis, the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitousi Commission identified the limits of GDP as an indicator of economic performance and social progress. It noted that the key defect of the GDP concept is under-measurement of externalities, natural resource depletion and biodiversity destruction. Indeed, non-market activities, such as the contribution of women to housework, are not measured at all. Specifically, the commission sought to shift the emphasis from measuring economic production to measuring people’s well-being. 
</p>
<p>Since 2008, the major economies, including most in G20, have constructed their national balance sheets in order to have a better understanding of the relationship between sectoral and international flows and stocks. The latest OECD report on natural capital and biodiversity found that out of 89 countries that implemented accounts consistent with the U.N. System of Environmental Economic Accounting, most are incomplete and only 34 have developed ecosystem accounts. Even today, the International Financial Reporting Standards have no separate disclosure standard on non-traditional indicators such as environmental, social and governance measures. As any data scientist will tell you: “garbage in, garbage out.” The quality of lofty quantitative economic models depends on data quality. 
</p>
<p>“If we consider Earth as a living being, we can easily amend the current accounting measurement frameworks to take into consideration human interactions with nature.” </p>
<p>Each sovereign country behaves today as if its monetary, fiscal or consumption policies operate in a silo, impacting its own citizens only. Since there is no global government or central bank, no one compiles a global monetary and fiscal accounting to see if what individual nations do is consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals for the planet as a whole. Citizens are not given a complete picture of what alternative policies are available that could help the planet as a whole. 
</p>
<p>But if we consider Earth as a living being, we can easily amend the current accounting measurement frameworks to take into consideration human interactions with nature. For example, suppose we create an extra “nature” sector for national and international economic accounting systems. We could keep records of how much it has “transacted” in terms of carbon emissions and capture, usage of natural resources, pollution and more.
</p>
<p>There is much work to do to standardize concepts, frameworks and disclosure requirements. But the building blocks for the compilation of the One-Earth Balance Sheet, with the input of natural and social scientists and communities are broadly available and can be accelerated to create a common narrative on dealing with climate change and inclusivity. 
</p>
<p>Having a One-Earth perspective would allow more pluralistic debate over the costs and benefits of applying unilateral policies, such as carbon tariffs that shift the costs to exporting countries. If there is a shortage of funds to finance carbon-reducing investments, could these be funded by a globally agreed Tobin-tax on financial trading, which could cut short-term speculation for better resource allocation? 
</p>
<p>A One-Earth Balance Sheet would be able to identify where our largest imbalances are. Many are already obvious, such as social, income and wealth. But others, such as consumption behavior relating to pollution, carbon emissions and choke points (vulnerable links) in global networks and supply chains, have not yet been mapped adequately. 
</p>
<p>The pandemic has shown how we need whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches to deal with our collective challenges. The lack of good data at the national and global level has led to incomplete and flawed policies, as well as misunderstandings that led to conflict. 
</p>
<p>The task of compiling a One-Earth Balance Sheet is beyond any single individual or group, as the data would be multidimensional and multidisciplinary. Concerned individuals and multilateral agencies should convene a global commission to give urgency and political support for this task &mdash; not from a national perspective, but rather a planetary one. All of us and the planet are impacted by existing individual, national, regional or geopolitical behavior. Getting the whole spectrum of academia, civil society and national and multilateral agencies to contribute to data collection to build the One-Earth Balance Sheet would help create shared efforts for a common understanding of shared threats.

But’s it’s temporary surge, he says. Yet Americans are still nervous – especially since energy and food prices don’t seem to fit that narrative especially well. Do you buy more heating because of a stimulus check you got months ago? Probably not.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So just how serious is the problem and what do we do about it?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Public Health is Key</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/csahm\">Claudia Sahm</a>, a senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute who has worked at the Federal Reserve and the Obama White House, sees higher prices at the pump and the grocery store as a real hardship to ordinary people: “It squeezed the budgets, particularly of low-income households who spend most of their money on necessities.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In her view, the Fed failed to see just how long it would take to contain the global pandemic. “The highly contagious delta variant disrupted labor markets and supply chains again,” observes Sahm. “Covid is the root of all the problems, and the only lasting solution is a public health one.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sahm urges the White House, as well as state and local governments, to get more people vaccinated ASAP through measures like employer mandates and making access to the vaccine easier. Other measures she advocates to keep prices from ticking up further include using the Strategic Oil Reserve, reducing trade tariffs, and continuing to work with ports to speed the processing of goods in the short term.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On the bright side, Sahm sees a helpful buffer in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 – namely the “stimulus checks and the new Child Tax Credit which have given families the income necessary to cover the higher prices.” She points out that consumer spending, after accounting for inflation, is increasing more than prices: “That is notably better than after the Great Recession when families got much less relief, and consumer spending grew slowly for years.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Infrastructure, Child Care Spending Will Help</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/pmalaney\">Pia Malaney</a>, Co-Founder and Director of The Center for Innovation, Growth and Society and Senior Economist at the <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/\">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, warns that “wages are not able to keep up and rising food and gas prices are hitting the pocketbooks of many Americans who are still reeling from the pandemic economy.” She notes that this has persuaded some to call for a cutback in proposed spending on Biden’s Build Back Better plan. But it is important to remember, she points out, “that much of the proposed spending will address exactly the labor and supply chain issues that are driving the rise in inflation.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Malaney is optimistic that money spent on infrastructure will improve roads and transportation, and that help with child care and education “will allow many women to re-enter the workforce, easing the tight labor market that is making it hard for employers to hire.” But she also observes that climate change is already causing costly damage that will have long term effects on economic output if not addressed. “While the rise in inflation is troubling, reigning it in at the cost of long term investments in people and the economy can be even more costly.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Political Turmoil, Greedy Oligopolists</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Delft University of Technology’s <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/sstorm\">Servaas Storm</a> also worries that consumer prices are eroding the real incomes of households, resulting in “all-round pessimism and growing recession fears, as shown in a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/two-thirds-of-adults-fear-a-recession-could-come-next-year-survey-finds.html\">recent CNBC poll</a>).” He warns that if we see a long, cold winter and rising energy prices, U.S. households will increasingly suffer from “fuel poverty” and the number of “winter deaths” will increase. Most households are likely in for a rough ride, he warns.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“All this is likely to lead to anger and upset among the population and to political repercussions for the U.S. mid-term elections in 2022,” predicts Storm. “The recent elections for governor in Virginia may well be the first of more electoral surprises.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Storm does not believe that the Fed has underestimated the problem. “Officials have been telling anyone who would listen to expect higher, transitory, inflation in the near term as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 crisis and gets back to normal,” says Storm. “And it has not raised interest rates, even with influential observers telling it to do so.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Fed thinks the problem is transitory, he notes, but a lot of folks still worry that higher inflation will become entrenched and we will see a rerun of 1970s stagflation, when supply shocks (the two oil crises) triggered a wage-price spiral in a stagnating economy with rising unemployment. “That’s due to a communication error on the part of the Fed,” says Storm. “They made a mistake in avoiding comments on the major role played by food and fuel prices.” Storm thinks that people with such fears are focused on the wrong issue -- stagflation is unlikely, he says, because there’s nothing to keep pushing up wages.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Labor unions in the U.S. have been crushed and no longer constitute a force for wage-cost-push inflation,” he says. “It is true that strikes and work stoppages are rising, but their impact at the macroeconomic level is still negligible.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He points out that while nominal wages are rising, especially in specific industries where workers left during the pandemic and are reluctant to come back, it’s not nearly enough to offset the sudden increase in cost of living. In his view, we should be looking at how firms in various industries, from retail and manufacturing to biotech, have boosted their profit margins, which inflates prices.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> noted recently that nearly two out of three of the biggest U.S. publicly traded companies have reported fatter profit margins so far this year than they did over the same stretch of 2019, before the pandemic,” observes Storm. “Rising inflation makes it possible for firms to hide their increased profit margins from customers.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Nearly 100 of these corporations raised profit margins by more than 50%,” says Storm. “Part of the inflation is therefore due to profit-push – and we should blame the oligopolists, rather than the working population.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/tferguson\">Thomas Ferguson</a>, Research Director at the <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/\">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, who has just released <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/2020s-knife-edge-election-an-analysis\">a new study on what drove the 2020 election</a>, put it this way: “We don’t’ have a wage-price spiral. We have a price-wage spiral.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Storm thinks the Fed is right so far in refraining from increasing the interest rate in order to curb inflation. “That’s a blunt instrument which can bring inflation down, but only by depressing consumption and investment demand,” notes Storm. In his view, the problem is not mainly about too much demand, but rather supply-side problems “in very specific global and domestic production chains impacted by the pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Higher interest rates won’t solve bottlenecks in (just-in-time) commodity chains,” he warns, “so instead of solving inflation they will just depress aggregate demand and push the economy into recession.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sure, says Storm, a recession will lower inflation. “But it would amount to a clear instance of ‘operation succeeded but patient died.’”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Storm points out that there is another reason why the Fed will remain careful when raising the interest rate, namely “the high indebtedness of U.S. households, banks and corporation in combination with strongly inflated asset markets.” Raising interest rates too quickly, or even at all, could trigger painful financial-sector adjustments and a crash in the dramatically overvalued stock market and derivative markets, he warns. And that could mean “a balance-sheet-restructuring recession of similar proportions to the one following the financial crisis of 2008.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yikes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Bottom line, says Storm, is that the Fed will likely err on the safe side in allowing higher inflation with the hopes that it will be short-lived rather than risking a major crash.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So what to do to help the ordinary people who are hurting? “A sensible policy response to the inflationary pressures would make a distinction between the short run and the long run,” Storm explains. “In the short run, the government can impose temporary price controls (and rationing) on energy, especially.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He agrees with Sahm that government agencies should act vigorously to unsnarl supply-chain bottlenecks, adding that there should be “mandatory cooperation moves between firms and unions, reversing decades of deregulation, to solve the present trucking crisis, for instance.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Storm also urges direct income support to the poorest households to compensate for higher energy costs. This could be paid for out of higher taxes imposed on the super-rich (say, the richest 1%-5% of U.S. households or on corporate profits, which in many cases have grown because of higher profit mark-ups).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The collateral damage of such targeted fiscal interventions would be much smaller than the negative side-effects of higher interest rates, and the distributive implications will be progressive (rather than regressive),” notes Storm.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the long run, Storm sees the need for increasing the energy efficiency of homes and transportation, as well as expanding the renewable energy supply system and to lower the dependence on fossil fuels. He would also like to see governments curbing speculation in oil, gas and coal futures markets, which he says is now contributing to higher energy prices and inflation. “The Fed can outlaw the trade in socially useless crypto-currencies,” says Storm, noting that “Bitcoin mining consumes around 0.6% of global electricity production, which is roughly equal to the annual energy consumption of the 21.4 million people of Sri Lanka.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Of course all these responses require cooperation, coordination and planning between the various actors including the federal government, state governments, the Fed, unions, corporations, the CFTC, and political parties,” Storm points out. “Absent that, we are left with second-best and third-best ersatz-solutions – which will not work.” He warns that how this ends will depend on the vagaries of the coming winter, the fancies of the coronavirus, the speed at which supply-chain bottlenecks will be removed, and the dynamics of heightened political polarization in 2022 and beyond.
</p>
<p>

                                    <p>Just in time for the holidays and the winter season, prices are rising at eye-popping rates. Energy costs have leapt 30% in the past 12 months, and food is way up -- the price of meat, poultry, fish and eggs together rose almost 12% over the same period.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>I have just seen a $14 rotisserie chicken. Okay, it was Manhattan. But still.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>All told, the consumer price index surged 6.2% from a year ago in October, the most since December 1990. According to the Labor Department, that wipes out any increases in wages workers have seen, with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/inflation-has-taken-away-all-the-wage-gains-for-workers-and-then-some.html\">real wages falling 0.5% from September to October</a>.

<p> 
</p>
<p>Neel Kashkari, the Minneapolis Fed Chair, has just said that it’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/581479-minneapolis-fed-president-says-inflation-will-likely-see-higher\">going to get worse</a> in the coming months, blaming rising prices on people buying more goods and services with extra money from stimulus checks and also to Covid-related supply chain snags. But’s it’s temporary surge, he says. Yet Americans are still nervous – especially since energy and food prices don’t seem to fit that narrative especially well. Do you buy more heating because of a stimulus check you got months ago? Probably not.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>So just how serious is the problem and what do we do about it?
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Public Health is Key</b>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/csahm\">Claudia Sahm</a>, a senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute who has worked at the Federal Reserve and the Obama White House, sees higher prices at the pump and the grocery store as a real hardship to ordinary people: “It squeezed the budgets, particularly of low-income households who spend most of their money on necessities.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In her view, the Fed failed to see just how long it would take to contain the global pandemic. “The highly contagious delta variant disrupted labor markets and supply chains again,” observes Sahm. “Covid is the root of all the problems, and the only lasting solution is a public health one.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Sahm urges the White House, as well as state and local governments, to get more people vaccinated ASAP through measures like employer mandates and making access to the vaccine easier. Other measures she advocates to keep prices from ticking up further include using the Strategic Oil Reserve, reducing trade tariffs, and continuing to work with ports to speed the processing of goods in the short term. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On the bright side, Sahm sees a helpful buffer in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 – namely the “stimulus checks and the new Child Tax Credit which have given families the income necessary to cover the higher prices.” She points out that consumer spending, after accounting for inflation, is increasing more than prices: “That is notably better than after the Great Recession when families got much less relief, and consumer spending grew slowly for years.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Infrastructure, Child Care Spending Will Help</b>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/pmalaney\">Pia Malaney</a>, Co-Founder and Director of The Center for Innovation, Growth and Society and Senior Economist at the <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/\">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, warns that “wages are not able to keep up and rising food and gas prices are hitting the pocketbooks of many Americans who are still reeling from the pandemic economy.” She notes that this has persuaded some to call for a cutback in proposed spending on Biden’s Build Back Better plan. But it is important to remember, she points out, “that much of the proposed spending will address exactly the labor and supply chain issues that are driving the rise in inflation.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Malaney is optimistic that money spent on infrastructure will improve roads and transportation, and that help with child care and education “will allow many women to re-enter the workforce, easing the tight labor market that is making it hard for employers to hire.” But she also observes that climate change is already causing costly damage that will have long term effects on economic output if not addressed. “While the rise in inflation is troubling, reigning it in at the cost of long term investments in people and the economy can be even more costly.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Political Turmoil, Greedy Oligopolists</b>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Delft University of Technology’s <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/sstorm\">Servaas Storm</a> also worries that consumer prices are eroding the real incomes of households, resulting in “all-round pessimism and growing recession fears, as shown in a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/two-thirds-of-adults-fear-a-recession-could-come-next-year-survey-finds.html\">recent CNBC poll</a>).” He warns that if we see a long, cold winter and rising energy prices, U.S. households will increasingly suffer from “fuel poverty” and the number of “winter deaths” will increase. Most households are likely in for a rough ride, he warns.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>“All this is likely to lead to anger and upset among the population and to political repercussions for the U.S. mid-term elections in 2022,” predicts Storm. “The recent elections for governor in Virginia may well be the first of more electoral surprises.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Storm does not believe that the Fed has underestimated the problem. “Officials have been telling anyone who would listen to expect higher, transitory, inflation in the near term as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 crisis and gets back to normal,” says Storm. “And it has not raised interest rates, even with influential observers telling it to do so.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Fed thinks the problem is transitory, he notes, but a lot of folks still worry that higher inflation will become entrenched and we will see a rerun of 1970s stagflation, when supply shocks (the two oil crises) triggered a wage-price spiral in a stagnating economy with rising unemployment. “That’s due to a communication error on the part of the Fed,” says Storm. “They made a mistake in avoiding comments on the major role played by food and fuel prices.” Storm thinks that people with such fears are focused on the wrong issue -- stagflation is unlikely, he says, because there’s nothing to keep pushing up wages.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>“Labor unions in the U.S. have been crushed and no longer constitute a force for wage-cost-push inflation,” he says. “It is true that strikes and work stoppages are rising, but their impact at the macroeconomic level is still negligible.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>He points out that while nominal wages are rising, especially in specific industries where workers left during the pandemic and are reluctant to come back, it’s not nearly enough to offset the sudden increase in cost of living. In his view, we should be looking at how firms in various industries, from retail and manufacturing to biotech, have boosted their profit margins, which inflates prices.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>“The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> noted recently that nearly two out of three of the biggest U.S. publicly traded companies have reported fatter profit margins so far this year than they did over the same stretch of 2019, before the pandemic,” observes Storm. “Rising inflation makes it possible for firms to hide their increased profit margins from customers.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>“Nearly 100 of these corporations raised profit margins by more than 50%,” says Storm. “Part of the inflation is therefore due to profit-push – and we should blame the oligopolists, rather than the working population.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/tferguson\">Thomas Ferguson</a>, Research Director at the <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/\">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, who has just released <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/2020s-knife-edge-election-an-analysis\">a new study on what drove the 2020 election</a>, put it this way: “We don’t’ have a wage-price spiral. We have a price-wage spiral.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Storm thinks the Fed is right so far in refraining from increasing the interest rate in order to curb inflation. “That’s a blunt instrument which can bring inflation down, but only by depressing consumption and investment demand,” notes Storm. In his view, the problem is not mainly about too much demand, but rather supply-side problems “in very specific global and domestic production chains impacted by the pandemic.” 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>“Higher interest rates won’t solve bottlenecks in (just-in-time) commodity chains,” he warns, “so instead of solving inflation they will just depress aggregate demand and push the economy into recession.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Sure, says Storm, a recession will lower inflation. “But it would amount to a clear instance of ‘operation succeeded but patient died.’” 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Storm points out that there is another reason why the Fed will remain careful when raising the interest rate, namely “the high indebtedness of U.S. households, banks and corporation in combination with strongly inflated asset markets.” Raising interest rates too quickly, or even at all, could trigger painful financial-sector adjustments and a crash in the dramatically overvalued stock market and derivative markets, he warns. And that could mean “a balance-sheet-restructuring recession of similar proportions to the one following the financial crisis of 2008.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Yikes.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Bottom line, says Storm, is that the Fed will likely err on the safe side in allowing higher inflation with the hopes that it will be short-lived rather than risking a major crash. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>So what to do to help the ordinary people who are hurting? “A sensible policy response to the inflationary pressures would make a distinction between the short run and the long run,” Storm explains. “In the short run, the government can impose temporary price controls (and rationing) on energy, especially.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>He agrees with Sahm that government agencies should act vigorously to unsnarl supply-chain bottlenecks, adding that there should be “mandatory cooperation moves between firms and unions, reversing decades of deregulation, to solve the present trucking crisis, for instance.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Storm also urges direct income support to the poorest households to compensate for higher energy costs. This could be paid for out of higher taxes imposed on the super-rich (say, the richest 1%-5% of U.S. households or on corporate profits, which in many cases have grown because of higher profit mark-ups).
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>“The collateral damage of such targeted fiscal interventions would be much smaller than the negative side-effects of higher interest rates, and the distributive implications will be progressive (rather than regressive),” notes Storm.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In the long run, Storm sees the need for increasing the energy efficiency of homes and transportation, as well as expanding the renewable energy supply system and to lower the dependence on fossil fuels. He would also like to see governments curbing speculation in oil, gas and coal futures markets, which he says is now contributing to higher energy prices and inflation. “The Fed can outlaw the trade in socially useless crypto-currencies,” says Storm, noting that “Bitcoin mining consumes around 0.6% of global electricity production, which is roughly equal to the annual energy consumption of the 21.4 million people of Sri Lanka.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>“Of course all these responses require cooperation, coordination and planning between the various actors including the federal government, state governments, the Fed, unions, corporations, the CFTC, and political parties,” Storm points out. “Absent that, we are left with second-best and third-best ersatz-solutions – which will not work.” He warns that how this ends will depend on the vagaries of the coming winter, the fancies of the coronavirus, the speed at which supply-chain bottlenecks will be removed, and the dynamics of heightened political polarization in 2022 and beyond.
</p>

<p>Fasten your seatbelts, folks.

                                "))) ("The Pandemic Triggered the Questioning of Current Governance Systems in Africa" "<p><strong>In this interview for INET’s COVID-19 and Africa series, <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/ctoulmin\">Camilla Toulmin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/Folashade\">Folashadé Soulé</a> discuss with Dr Ibrahim Mayaki, CEO of the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) about how the effectiveness of State responses to COVID-19 in Africa have been very visible, and are leading to far greater public scrutiny of the public sector and prospects for better governance.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayaki of the Republic of Niger has been the Chief Executive Officer of the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) since January 2009. A former Prime Minister of Niger, from 1997 to 2000, Dr. Mayaki set up the Analysis Centre for Public Policy in Senegal in 2000. He was a guest Professor at the University of Paris XI (2000-2004). He went on to serve as Executive Director of the Rural Hub, based in Dakar, Senegal, before taking up his current position.</strong>
</p>
<p><em>In our discussions with African leaders and thinkers so far, many see the COVID pandemic as laying bare the weaknesses in current economic structures and relationships, and that Africa’s COVID recovery offers a starting point for doing things differently. Do you agree, and what lessons do you take from the COVID crisis for changes in Africa’s future economic direction? What has to change?</em>
</p>
<p>My first point is that such views have a certain truth. However, it also has to be put in perspective. It is true that, due to COVID-19, Africa has known its first economic recession in the last 25 years. It is recognised by multilateral institutions that generally, we had good economic growth rates and well-designed macro-economic policies in most cases. We were doing quite well and sustainability of debt in the pre-COVID period was fundamentally not an issue. However, there were some red flags for certain countries to be more careful, but overall, the situation was not alarming.
</p>
<p>The second point is that the economic model we have been following is a consequence of structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s and 90s, and which was not sufficiently inclusive. We still are the most unequal region in the world. Inequality and youth unemployment are very important issues. The median age in Africa is 19 years and every year we have about 20 million young people coming onto the job market, but only 12 million jobs are created, and these are mainly in the informal sector. So, inclusivity was not the characteristic of that growth but nevertheless, we did grow. The COVID-19 pandemic accentuated existing fragilities, which you can see mostly in the social sectors – education, health, etc. - and we hadn’t invested sufficiently in primary health care. Evidently our capacity to respond to the pandemic was weakened by this limitation. We really need to take primary health care more seriously. Before COVID-19, we had 34-35 million children out of school and evidently this has increased with the pandemic. Pre-existing fragilities have been worsened during the COVID period.
</p>
<p>The third point, to which we don’t give sufficient importance, which is happening as a consequence of the pandemic, is a questioning of the governance systems we have had till now. Why? The pandemic created a situation where governments face public opinion and public scrutiny directly, and the effectiveness of the solutions they are promoting can be gauged immediately. If you supplied sufficient masks or not, it was seen. If you had sufficient diagnostic tests, it could be seen. This immediate visibility of the efficiency of the State was immediately sensed by the population. It created a dynamic evolution where trust in public institutions has been reinforced in places where the response has been positive, or severely damaged because the response was not there. This is the most important facet from which will come a new economic model. Till now, governments and States had the monopoly of designing public policies. COVID-19 has led to communities becoming more pre-eminent, so we will likely see more co-creation of public policies. If it happens well, it will allow a reform of the economic model. If it doesn’t happen, we may see violent changes in certain parts of the continent.
</p>
<p><em>The pandemic has shown the many advantages of coordinated collective action by African institutions, international institutions like the WHO, the World Bank and African governments, in addressing the health crisis early on and looking for financing. What are the key preliminary lessons that can be derived from this collective action and exercise of African agency for the future?</em>
</p>
<p>The first important point is that Africans could give concrete substance to the concept of regional integration. We have been promoting, discussing and reflecting on African integration through investment in physical infrastructure, but in this particular situation and in response to the pandemic, we could see an immediate reaction based on regional integration. You will remember that all the Ministers of Health met in Addis Ababa as soon as the pandemic started in February 2020. We had an organised and structured African Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and they drafted a roadmap which was immediately implemented in all countries, with the CDC outlining what needed to be done; for example, how to collect and report data et cetera. At the African Union level, we started putting in place mechanisms for the procurement of personal protective equipment, and diagnostics, and began thinking about a vaccine even before the COVAX system started. So, the content and purpose of regional integration in that domain was clearly understood by Africans and that has been one of the big lessons of the crisis. We realised we could use the same kind of approach in other domains beyond the immediate health issues. It also opened new reflections for African institutions. The World Bank, IMF, and EU have been helpful by accompanying us, without getting into the detailed discussions and decisions that were led by Africans.
</p>
<p>The second lesson is this - most of the time when we design public policy, we bring our ideas and co-construct with donors and partners. However, this time we didn’t co-construct in this way but moved out on our own path which gave a real, tangible sense to what regional integration could do. At the same time, it opened new pathways for reflection in a very concrete manner. Access to vaccines was a real issue so we quickly started talking about vaccine manufacturing and that raised the question about broader manufacturing capacities on the continent. This concrete example has pushed us to reflect on the way we had been proceeding with regional integration. It is true that the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), which was looked at rather theoretically by most Africans, even though it was a huge step forward, suddenly made sense. This is because it could enhance the creation of regional value chains, sharing lessons learned about manufacturing, especially from specific countries like South Africa which could produce and link to the other parts of the continent. Regional integration became even more real, once we started looking at the global scene. What we saw was vaccine nationalism, and we saw that global solidarity always starts with national solidarity. That meant that we as a continent really had to count on ourselves. If we look at the numbers of vaccinated people today, we see that in many countries there is a surplus of vaccines and people are talking about boosters. In contrast, in our countries, most people have not even had their first shot. So, there are economic questions about manufacturing, but there are also moral questions that need to be asked.
</p>
<p>My other point is around vaccines and government behaviour. Some governments succeeded very quickly in getting vaccines accepted, while others couldn’t convince their populations to get vaccinated, despite having access to various media sources and much more information than in the past. It is therefore interesting to ask why some governments succeeded and others did not succeed in this domain. We have a list of countries where there is a surplus and people are not queuing to get the vaccine, and other places where there is a deficit and people are very keen to be vaccinated. Communities have played a big role here. Generally, the ordinary citizen believes much more in their community and on the views of local groups than what the state and governments are saying.
</p>
<p><em>African countries will not be able to achieve their ambitions for economic growth and structural change without access to energy. COP26 has been an important moment to discuss climate and the constraints this places on Africa’s energy choices, but this is at a time when many countries are also discovering new reserves of oil and gas. How should fossil-fuel-rich countries navigate their future, given huge needs for energy on the one hand, and risks from stranded assets and climate change on the other?</em>
</p>
<p>Most western countries industrialised using fossil fuels and have benefitted enormously from them over the last 200 years, an era of explosive growth. Historically, Africa has been the least emitter of greenhouse gases, the principal drivers of climate change. This is nothing new. However, African countries have still made strong commitments to the Paris Agreement, in order to do their bit and contribute their part to the global goal of reducing warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. There is, on the one hand, a commitment to an international accord, but there is also, on the other hand, the sense that as we industrialise, we shouldn’t make the same errors that others have made. We need “green industrialisation”. But the problem is no one in the history of economics has gone through a process of green industrialisation, there is no model. It will need the construction of a fundamentally innovative process, which requires transfer of technology. When African countries want to use gas to be able to industrialise quickly, there are some global institutions that are critical of this use of gas. But look at California, where their renewable energy supplies rely on gas for base-load power. Within our new economic model, we must think about what kind of transition we want to take. We should not be blinded by severe commitments because we still have 50% of our population who do not have access to energy. Our transition cannot be one that increases extreme poverty. It must not increase the burden on the most vulnerable. We should think of a green energy mix that can allow us to have a reasonable implementation of commitments and at the same time reduce extreme poverty, which has been rising during the pandemic. That’s the way we should think about energy. We cannot reject coal. If you reject coal in South Africa today, you will significantly reduce people’s access to energy, since coal remains central to the grid. Nonetheless, we should have a mix of energy sources, and think about the use of renewables in an intelligent manner, following a learning curve in coherence with reducing extreme poverty and achieving more inclusive growth. Otherwise, we will be doubly penalised because we fully implement commitments, which doesn’t make sense. We need incentives to move towards green industrialisation.
</p>
<p><em>Some initiatives associating with the private sector were launched during the pandemic, such as the mVacciNation digital toolbox with Vodacom, Mezzanine and NEPAD. How do you assess the impact of such joint initiatives? Do you think the African private sector has been involved enough during the crisis? What lessons can be derived for the future?</em>
</p>
<p>There are some critical issues here. First, if you look at indicators of innovation and levels of expenditure in R&D in Africa, it is mostly driven by the private sector. Sometimes governments create an ecosystem that allows the private sector to be much more innovative. It happens in Kenya and some other countries. Innovation comes from the private sector, and if governments want to implement innovative solutions, they have to partner with the private sector. That’s the spirit with which we went into our partnership with Vodacom, MTN and now Orange for the mVacciNation solution so we could tap into the innovative capacity of the private sector through these partnerships. We found a very receptive private sector to engage with, not only the big ones like Vodacom but also a full range of start-ups that are emerging from countries across the continent and have enormous energy in terms of innovation. So, this is the context in which the governments are working. Some have pushed in a resolute manner in the creation of an ecosystem that can let these innovative institutions emerge. Some haven’t done it at all, but this hasn’t prevented these actors to rise up.
</p>
<p>We realised that we could as a development agency of the African Union create very concrete partnerships with private entities. The receptivity of many governments has been very high because they realise they need to facilitate quicker, accelerated vaccination programmes, get the data on how vaccination is going, and then correct and adapt it based on feedback. So this is also one of the lessons which can be drawn from the pandemic. The behaviour of central governments has been shaken because they have discovered two things: they recognised their weaknesses and two, they have at the same time understood that there are many innovative ideas happening, structures, products and systems from which they can benefit. But in order to do so, they need to partner with business, which demands a fundamental mental shift. Most civil servants in African countries do not have a private sector culture, so their ability to link with them is somehow limited.
</p>
<p>We need to create a space where there can be intercultural interaction between government and business, which allows this partnership with the private sector to flourish. We also have decided to promote this, and we have an initiative called 100,000 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. We know most employment in Africa is in the informal sector - 80% of those employed in Africa are in the MSMEs, and the pandemic hit them very seriously. Our idea was to create a digital platform supported by financial institutions – we have a partnership with ECOBANK and accompany them in managing the financial and institutional stresses which the pandemic has brought. We created a Digital Academy and a digital platform to allow them better access to finance. Why a Digital Academy? To allow them to move from informal to more formal structures. This partnership with the private sector helps shape and change the behaviour of our states and governments culturally and structurally too. I like the work of Mariana Mazzucato very much, and her book The Entrepreneurial State, which describes an approach that is greatly needed in many of our countries.
</p>
<p><em>As a former Prime Minister of your country Niger, and President of the Sahel and West Africa Club of OECD, we must ask you how you see the future of the region. Ten years on from the overthrow of President Gadhafi of Libya, terrorist and jihadist groups have embedded themselves very firmly in much of Mali, and parts of Niger and Burkina Faso. Neighbouring countries, like Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal, are increasingly concerned with spill-over. Military solutions don’t seem to be working. What political and economic measures could bring a better result?</em>
</p>
<p>The first thing the political elite in the Sahel must do is to recognise that they are the principal people responsible for this situation with the jihadists. That’s absolutely fundamental. If you think that jihadism is just an import from elsewhere, and the consequence of the extremely negative NATO intervention in Libya - while this does play a role, it is not the main cause of jihadism. If you say it’s the acceleration of the influence of particular religious figures, or Middle Eastern countries which have established radical religious education networks, if you believe this you are way off the mark. You are not facing reality. The reality is that our governments in the Sahel have completely neglected the territorial dimensions of planning and implementation of development. If you put two maps of the Sahel one on top of the other, you see those areas where the government has been active to improve health and education, and compare with those areas where jihadism is rife, you realise they have grown in those locations where the government has been absent. We need to recognise this as the elite.
</p>
<p>Moreover, our response cannot be based exclusively on military intervention. The response must be the presence of the State in those zones that feel they have been completely abandoned. Evidently, the presence of the State currently demands a military presence, but the military by themselves are clearly not enough. The fundamental question for the Sahel is the re-establishment and re-founding of the State. There is a lot of writing and literature on this subject, but the re-foundation cannot be done by elites based in ministries in capital cities. Let me give you an example. When I was Prime Minister, we launched a survey before an exercise in national planning to see what the population really wanted. We asked the population of Niger about priorities for health, water, roads, education, health, and so on. Astonishingly, what came to the top of the list as the priority across the country, was not water, health or education, it was justice. It was a system of justice that was equitable, accessible, and not corrupt. They needed this to live their lives with dignity. In this context, you see that a military solution cannot provide all the answers. Clearly, if you have people with Kalashnikovs, you need people on the other side who also have Kalashnikovs. Given the evolution of the conflict, there are people who are now drawing a livelihood from these criminal activities, which have nothing to do with jihadism. It is easy to recruit young people at US$2 to $3 per day who become kings and lords in their own right when they hold a Kalashnikov.
</p>
<p>We need to rethink the presence of the State. The army cannot sort out the problem. What we need is the State to be present in a decentralised, locally rooted form. This demands the presence of public services, and engagement with local communities in deciding what is to be done. The State has to be decentralised. It is a new way of thinking. If we don’t go in this direction, we will follow the route of Afghanistan – many billions spent and nothing to show for it. States must be present and make difficult but necessary choices in budget expenses. They should no longer prioritize the functioning of ministries that have no capacity to deliver anything in practice. We must help to construct local communities themselves who can then become a rampart and defence against the jihadists. Unfortunately, this essential shift in approach is not well enough recognised and understood. Instead, we see the multiplication of military actions and the corresponding spread of jihadist and terrorist groups. Too many international actors also participate in the illusion that this is the way to make progress.
</p>
<p>Changing course won’t be easy. It will be slow and long, but we must follow the right road. We must renew the State, decentralise our budgets, and reinforce community-based actions so that people can judge for themselves that they are better off under the aegis of the State than jihadist groups. This should be our aim for the medium and longer-term. At the OECD Sahel and West Africa Club, we are trying to create space where people from a wide variety of backgrounds can meet, in what we call the Concertations sahéliennes to ask the real questions and co-construct policies and solutions with actors on the ground.

                                    <p><strong>In this interview for INET’s COVID-19 and Africa series, <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/ctoulmin\">Camilla Toulmin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/Folashade\">Folashadé Soulé</a> discuss with Dr Ibrahim Mayaki, CEO of the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) about how the effectiveness of State responses to COVID-19 in Africa have been very visible, and are leading to far greater public scrutiny of the public sector and prospects for better governance.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayaki of the Republic of Niger has been the Chief Executive Officer of the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) since January 2009. A former Prime Minister of Niger, from 1997 to 2000, Dr. Mayaki set up the Analysis Centre for Public Policy in Senegal in 2000. He was a guest Professor at the University of Paris XI (2000-2004). He went on to serve as Executive Director of the Rural Hub, based in Dakar, Senegal, before taking up his current position.</strong>
</p>
<p><em>In our discussions with African leaders and thinkers so far, many see the COVID pandemic as laying bare the weaknesses in current economic structures and relationships, and that Africa’s COVID recovery offers a starting point for doing things differently. Do you agree, and what lessons do you take from the COVID crisis for changes in Africa’s future economic direction? What has to change?</em>
</p>
<p>My first point is that such views have a certain truth. However, it also has to be put in perspective. It is true that, due to COVID-19, Africa has known its first economic recession in the last 25 years. It is recognised by multilateral institutions that generally, we had good economic growth rates and well-designed macro-economic policies in most cases. We were doing quite well and sustainability of debt in the pre-COVID period was fundamentally not an issue. However, there were some red flags for certain countries to be more careful, but overall, the situation was not alarming.
</p>
<p>The second point is that the economic model we have been following is a consequence of structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s and 90s, and which was not sufficiently inclusive. We still are the most unequal region in the world. Inequality and youth unemployment are very important issues. The median age in Africa is 19 years and every year we have about 20 million young people coming onto the job market, but only 12 million jobs are created, and these are mainly in the informal sector. So, inclusivity was not the characteristic of that growth but nevertheless, we did grow. The COVID-19 pandemic accentuated existing fragilities, which you can see mostly in the social sectors – education, health, etc. - and we hadn’t invested sufficiently in primary health care. Evidently our capacity to respond to the pandemic was weakened by this limitation. We really need to take primary health care more seriously. Before COVID-19, we had 34-35 million children out of school and evidently this has increased with the pandemic. Pre-existing fragilities have been worsened during the COVID period.
</p>
<p>The third point, to which we don’t give sufficient importance, which is happening as a consequence of the pandemic, is a questioning of the governance systems we have had till now. Why? The pandemic created a situation where governments face public opinion and public scrutiny directly, and the effectiveness of the solutions they are promoting can be gauged immediately. If you supplied sufficient masks or not, it was seen. If you had sufficient diagnostic tests, it could be seen. This immediate visibility of the efficiency of the State was immediately sensed by the population. It created a dynamic evolution where trust in public institutions has been reinforced in places where the response has been positive, or severely damaged because the response was not there. This is the most important facet from which will come a new economic model. Till now, governments and States had the monopoly of designing public policies. COVID-19 has led to communities becoming more pre-eminent, so we will likely see more co-creation of public policies. If it happens well, it will allow a reform of the economic model. If it doesn’t happen, we may see violent changes in certain parts of the continent.
</p>
<p><em>The pandemic has shown the many advantages of coordinated collective action by African institutions, international institutions like the WHO, the World Bank and African governments, in addressing the health crisis early on and looking for financing. What are the key preliminary lessons that can be derived from this collective action and exercise of African agency for the future?</em>
</p>
<p>The first important point is that Africans could give concrete substance to the concept of regional integration. We have been promoting, discussing and reflecting on African integration through investment in physical infrastructure, but in this particular situation and in response to the pandemic, we could see an immediate reaction based on regional integration. You will remember that all the Ministers of Health met in Addis Ababa as soon as the pandemic started in February 2020. We had an organised and structured African Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and they drafted a roadmap which was immediately implemented in all countries, with the CDC outlining what needed to be done; for example, how to collect and report data et cetera. At the African Union level, we started putting in place mechanisms for the procurement of personal protective equipment, and diagnostics, and began thinking about a vaccine even before the COVAX system started. So, the content and purpose of regional integration in that domain was clearly understood by Africans and that has been one of the big lessons of the crisis. We realised we could use the same kind of approach in other domains beyond the immediate health issues. It also opened new reflections for African institutions. The World Bank, IMF, and EU have been helpful by accompanying us, without getting into the detailed discussions and decisions that were led by Africans.
</p>
<p>The second lesson is this - most of the time when we design public policy, we bring our ideas and co-construct with donors and partners. However, this time we didn’t co-construct in this way but moved out on our own path which gave a real, tangible sense to what regional integration could do. At the same time, it opened new pathways for reflection in a very concrete manner. Access to vaccines was a real issue so we quickly started talking about vaccine manufacturing and that raised the question about broader manufacturing capacities on the continent. This concrete example has pushed us to reflect on the way we had been proceeding with regional integration. It is true that the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), which was looked at rather theoretically by most Africans, even though it was a huge step forward, suddenly made sense. This is because it could enhance the creation of regional value chains, sharing lessons learned about manufacturing, especially from specific countries like South Africa which could produce and link to the other parts of the continent. Regional integration became even more real, once we started looking at the global scene. What we saw was vaccine nationalism, and we saw that global solidarity always starts with national solidarity. That meant that we as a continent really had to count on ourselves. If we look at the numbers of vaccinated people today, we see that in many countries there is a surplus of vaccines and people are talking about boosters. In contrast, in our countries, most people have not even had their first shot. So, there are economic questions about manufacturing, but there are also moral questions that need to be asked.
</p>
<p>My other point is around vaccines and government behaviour. Some governments succeeded very quickly in getting vaccines accepted, while others couldn’t convince their populations to get vaccinated, despite having access to various media sources and much more information than in the past. It is therefore interesting to ask why some governments succeeded and others did not succeed in this domain. We have a list of countries where there is a surplus and people are not queuing to get the vaccine, and other places where there is a deficit and people are very keen to be vaccinated. Communities have played a big role here. Generally, the ordinary citizen believes much more in their community and on the views of local groups than what the state and governments are saying.
</p>
<p><em>African countries will not be able to achieve their ambitions for economic growth and structural change without access to energy. COP26 has been an important moment to discuss climate and the constraints this places on Africa’s energy choices, but this is at a time when many countries are also discovering new reserves of oil and gas. How should fossil-fuel-rich countries navigate their future, given huge needs for energy on the one hand, and risks from stranded assets and climate change on the other?</em>
</p>
<p>Most western countries industrialised using fossil fuels and have benefitted enormously from them over the last 200 years, an era of explosive growth. Historically, Africa has been the least emitter of greenhouse gases, the principal drivers of climate change. This is nothing new. However, African countries have still made strong commitments to the Paris Agreement, in order to do their bit and contribute their part to the global goal of reducing warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. There is, on the one hand, a commitment to an international accord, but there is also, on the other hand, the sense that as we industrialise, we shouldn’t make the same errors that others have made. We need “green industrialisation”. But the problem is no one in the history of economics has gone through a process of green industrialisation, there is no model. It will need the construction of a fundamentally innovative process, which requires transfer of technology. When African countries want to use gas to be able to industrialise quickly, there are some global institutions that are critical of this use of gas. But look at California, where their renewable energy supplies rely on gas for base-load power. Within our new economic model, we must think about what kind of transition we want to take. We should not be blinded by severe commitments because we still have 50% of our population who do not have access to energy. Our transition cannot be one that increases extreme poverty. It must not increase the burden on the most vulnerable. We should think of a green energy mix that can allow us to have a reasonable implementation of commitments and at the same time reduce extreme poverty, which has been rising during the pandemic. That’s the way we should think about energy. We cannot reject coal. If you reject coal in South Africa today, you will significantly reduce people’s access to energy, since coal remains central to the grid. Nonetheless, we should have a mix of energy sources, and think about the use of renewables in an intelligent manner, following a learning curve in coherence with reducing extreme poverty and achieving more inclusive growth. Otherwise, we will be doubly penalised because we fully implement commitments, which doesn’t make sense. We need incentives to move towards green industrialisation.
</p>
<p><em>Some initiatives associating with the private sector were launched during the pandemic, such as the mVacciNation digital toolbox with Vodacom, Mezzanine and NEPAD. How do you assess the impact of such joint initiatives? Do you think the African private sector has been involved enough during the crisis? What lessons can be derived for the future?</em>
</p>
<p>There are some critical issues here. First, if you look at indicators of innovation and levels of expenditure in R&D in Africa, it is mostly driven by the private sector. Sometimes governments create an ecosystem that allows the private sector to be much more innovative. It happens in Kenya and some other countries. Innovation comes from the private sector, and if governments want to implement innovative solutions, they have to partner with the private sector. That’s the spirit with which we went into our partnership with Vodacom, MTN and now Orange for the mVacciNation solution so we could tap into the innovative capacity of the private sector through these partnerships. We found a very receptive private sector to engage with, not only the big ones like Vodacom but also a full range of start-ups that are emerging from countries across the continent and have enormous energy in terms of innovation. So, this is the context in which the governments are working. Some have pushed in a resolute manner in the creation of an ecosystem that can let these innovative institutions emerge. Some haven’t done it at all, but this hasn’t prevented these actors to rise up.
</p>
<p>We realised that we could as a development agency of the African Union create very concrete partnerships with private entities. The receptivity of many governments has been very high because they realise they need to facilitate quicker, accelerated vaccination programmes, get the data on how vaccination is going, and then correct and adapt it based on feedback. So this is also one of the lessons which can be drawn from the pandemic. The behaviour of central governments has been shaken because they have discovered two things: they recognised their weaknesses and two, they have at the same time understood that there are many innovative ideas happening, structures, products and systems from which they can benefit. But in order to do so, they need to partner with business, which demands a fundamental mental shift. Most civil servants in African countries do not have a private sector culture, so their ability to link with them is somehow limited.
</p>
<p>We need to create a space where there can be intercultural interaction between government and business, which allows this partnership with the private sector to flourish. We also have decided to promote this, and we have an initiative called 100,000 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. We know most employment in Africa is in the informal sector - 80% of those employed in Africa are in the MSMEs, and the pandemic hit them very seriously. Our idea was to create a digital platform supported by financial institutions – we have a partnership with ECOBANK and accompany them in managing the financial and institutional stresses which the pandemic has brought. We created a Digital Academy and a digital platform to allow them better access to finance. Why a Digital Academy? To allow them to move from informal to more formal structures. This partnership with the private sector helps shape and change the behaviour of our states and governments culturally and structurally too. I like the work of Mariana Mazzucato very much, and her book The Entrepreneurial State, which describes an approach that is greatly needed in many of our countries.
</p>
<p><em>As a former Prime Minister of your country Niger, and President of the Sahel and West Africa Club of OECD, we must ask you how you see the future of the region. Ten years on from the overthrow of President Gadhafi of Libya, terrorist and jihadist groups have embedded themselves very firmly in much of Mali, and parts of Niger and Burkina Faso. Neighbouring countries, like Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal, are increasingly concerned with spill-over. Military solutions don’t seem to be working. What political and economic measures could bring a better result?</em>
</p>
<p>The first thing the political elite in the Sahel must do is to recognise that they are the principal people responsible for this situation with the jihadists. That’s absolutely fundamental. If you think that jihadism is just an import from elsewhere, and the consequence of the extremely negative NATO intervention in Libya - while this does play a role, it is not the main cause of jihadism. If you say it’s the acceleration of the influence of particular religious figures, or Middle Eastern countries which have established radical religious education networks, if you believe this you are way off the mark. You are not facing reality. The reality is that our governments in the Sahel have completely neglected the territorial dimensions of planning and implementation of development. If you put two maps of the Sahel one on top of the other, you see those areas where the government has been active to improve health and education, and compare with those areas where jihadism is rife, you realise they have grown in those locations where the government has been absent. We need to recognise this as the elite.
</p>
<p>Moreover, our response cannot be based exclusively on military intervention. The response must be the presence of the State in those zones that feel they have been completely abandoned. Evidently, the presence of the State currently demands a military presence, but the military by themselves are clearly not enough. The fundamental question for the Sahel is the re-establishment and re-founding of the State. There is a lot of writing and literature on this subject, but the re-foundation cannot be done by elites based in ministries in capital cities. Let me give you an example. When I was Prime Minister, we launched a survey before an exercise in national planning to see what the population really wanted. We asked the population of Niger about priorities for health, water, roads, education, health, and so on. Astonishingly, what came to the top of the list as the priority across the country, was not water, health or education, it was justice. It was a system of justice that was equitable, accessible, and not corrupt. They needed this to live their lives with dignity. In this context, you see that a military solution cannot provide all the answers. Clearly, if you have people with Kalashnikovs, you need people on the other side who also have Kalashnikovs. Given the evolution of the conflict, there are people who are now drawing a livelihood from these criminal activities, which have nothing to do with jihadism. It is easy to recruit young people at US$2 to $3 per day who become kings and lords in their own right when they hold a Kalashnikov.
</p>
<p>We need to rethink the presence of the State. The army cannot sort out the problem. What we need is the State to be present in a decentralised, locally rooted form. This demands the presence of public services, and engagement with local communities in deciding what is to be done. The State has to be decentralised. It is a new way of thinking. If we don’t go in this direction, we will follow the route of Afghanistan – many billions spent and nothing to show for it. States must be present and make difficult but necessary choices in budget expenses. They should no longer prioritize the functioning of ministries that have no capacity to deliver anything in practice. We must help to construct local communities themselves who can then become a rampart and defence against the jihadists. Unfortunately, this essential shift in approach is not well enough recognised and understood. Instead, we see the multiplication of military actions and the corresponding spread of jihadist and terrorist groups. Too many international actors also participate in the illusion that this is the way to make progress.
</p>
<p>Changing course won’t be easy. It will be slow and long, but we must follow the right road. We must renew the State, decentralise our budgets, and reinforce community-based actions so that people can judge for themselves that they are better off under the aegis of the State than jihadist groups. This should be our aim for the medium and longer-term. At the OECD Sahel and West Africa Club, we are trying to create space where people from a wide variety of backgrounds can meet, in what we call the Concertations sahéliennes to ask the real questions and co-construct policies and solutions with actors on the ground.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Lancet <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/infographics/covid-mental-health\">reports</a> that cases of mental disorders have skyrocketed during the pandemic, including 53 million new cases of major depressive disorder and 76 million new cases of anxiety disorders. In the U.S., since spring of 2020, the National Center for Health Statistics has partnered with the Census Bureau on a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm\">new, rapid-turnaround data system to monitor depression and anxiety</a>, finding that <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/young-adults-living-alone-report-anxiety-depression-during-pandemic.html\">just over half of adults between the ages of 18 and 44 surveyed have reported symptoms</a>, as have <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/young-adults-living-alone-report-anxiety-depression-during-pandemic.html\">38% of adults living with children</a>.
</p>

<p>Researchers find that <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/\">younger adults, racial and ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers (most of them women</a>), have been <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm#:~:text=Younger%20adults%2C%20racial%2F,and%20elevated%20suicidal%20ideation.\">especially hard-hit</a> by mental distress and increased substance use.

Feedback loops within families mean that distressed parents transfer their anxiety and depression to children and vice versa. Three top U.S. organizations specializing in child and adolescent mental health, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recently declared a <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-a-national-emergency\">state of emergency</a> for the country’s youth, noting that Covid-19 and the ongoing struggle for racial justice have compounded trends of declining mental health among kids observed prior to 2020.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Many people find themselves in so much pain, they <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm#:~:text=Younger%20adults%2C%20racial%2F,and%20elevated%20suicidal%20ideation.\">think about dying</a>.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We can’t go on like this. Yet as alarming as it all sounds, signs indicate the crisis may only intensify. Covid-19 case rates may be falling in some areas, but the stresses associated with the pandemic are far from over – particularly as new variants spread, causing further disruption.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the U.S., those needing help face a serious shortage of mental health specialists (themselves often suffering from burnout and stress), a reduced number of psychiatric hospital beds, and a loss of job-based health insurance. Even for those who have insurance, a lack of in-network counselors and therapists means that care is frequently out of reach. And if you don’t live in a city, you may be out of luck: In some states, <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/over-one-third-of-americans-live-in-areas-lacking-mental-health-professionals/\">80% of the population</a> lives in an area where mental health professionals are scarce.

<p>The upshot is that millions are going without the treatment they require.

<p><strong>A Neurotoxic Virus</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The coronavirus itself attacks the mind. The infected may experience psychological symptoms like brain fog, and for some, the virus is nowhere near done with them after the initial infection. Long-haulers face a <a href=\"https://newsroom.osfhealthcare.org/many-covid-19-long-haulers-experience-mental-health-issues/\">nasty list of potential psychiatric disorders</a>, from phobias to anxiety. Some estimates suggest that as many as one in five people infected with Covid experience such disorders <a href=\"https://newsroom.osfhealthcare.org/many-covid-19-long-haulers-experience-mental-health-issues/\">within three months</a>. They get better, then they get worse, then they get better – up and down on a hellish rollercoaster.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>That’s not all -- <a href=\"https://www.bbrfoundation.org/content/study-reveals-adults-mental-disorders-are-significantly-higher-risk-covid-19-and-have-poorer\">research</a> has shown that those recently diagnosed with a mental disorder were significantly more likely to contract Covid -- and they tended to have worse outcomes than people infected who don't have a mental disorder. Researchers now suspect that having schizophrenia is second only to advanced age as the <a href=\"https://nyulangone.org/news/schizophrenia-second-only-age-greatest-risk-factor-covid-19-death\">highest risk factor for dying of Covid</a>. Nobody knows exactly why.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Viruses have long been <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/virus-connection-how-viruses-affect-psychiatric-pathologies\">linked to mental illness</a>, though just how they relate is not well-understood. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054463/\">As early as 1732</a>, clinicians noted that the flu often came with symptoms like neurasthenia, melancholy, hysteria, mental prostration, and insanity. When Covid hit, researchers looked back at the impact of the Spanish flu and other pandemics on mental health. Available data was scant, but demographer Svenn-Erik Mamelund had studied an increase in asylum hospitalizations from 1872 to 1929, finding that the number of first-time hospitalized patients with mental disorders attributed to influenza rose by an average annual factor of 7.2 in the 6 years following the Spanish flu pandemic. He also found that Spanish flu survivors reported sleep disturbances, depression, mental distraction, dizziness, and difficulties coping at work, and that influenza death rates in the U.S. during the years 1918-1920 were significantly and positively related to suicide rates.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Researchers in Great Britain reported an uptick in various nervous symptoms in patients recovering from Spanish flu infections, including neurasthenia, depression, nerve cell damage, and visual problems. Cases of encephalitis lethargica, an inflammatory central nervous system condition featuring psychotic and catatonic symptoms, also became common – 1 million cases were reported from the beginning of the Spanish flu pandemic in 1916 until the early 1930s. Clinicians surmised a link between the two, though causality is not established.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Spanish flu, and other types of flu, have been linked to psychosis. Early observers of influenza, <a href=\"http://bir.brandeis.edu/bitstream/handle/10192/30986/517%20p-4.pdf?sequence=1\">including Karl Menninger in 1919</a>, noted that people who contracted flu showed a variety of psychotic symptoms, particularly schizophrenia, and theorized that the viruses were neurotoxins. They were onto something. Evidence indicates that <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2778090\">Covid is indeed a neurotoxin</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the course of the current pandemic, doctors have seen infected teens <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/10/421666/3-teens-covid-19-developed-sudden-severe-psychiatric-symptoms-why\">suffer sudden psychosis</a>, and researchers are wondering if brain inflammation or immune reactions may account for <a href=\"https://casereports.bmj.com/content/14/4/e242538\">psychotic symptoms</a> in Covid patients with no history of psychiatric complaints.

<p><strong>Social Toxins Spreading</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p>Like wars and other devastating events, pandemics produce a wide range of mental health issues that hit poor and vulnerable groups especially hard. Covid is no exception.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Researchers Anne Case and Angus Deaton brought the term “deaths of despair” into public awareness with their studies of how mortality rates had risen sharply among certain populations since the 1990s. Their work has highlighted how the impact of stressors tends to widen the gulf between haves and have-nots already affecting the U.S and other countries.
</p>

</p>
<p>Shannon Monnat of the <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/epidemic-of-despair-could-haunt-america-long-after-covid\">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a> and researchers at the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-human-costs-of-the-pandemic-is-it-time-to-prioritize-well-being/\">Brookings Institute</a> point to increased stress from Covid-19 on populations already facing rising deaths of despair, particularly those in rural areas. Monnat, who tracked deaths of despair related to the opioid crisis prior to the pandemic, has been studying how the coronavirus has been affecting populations of drug users in New York state. She has found that drug supply chain disruptions, including the increased appearance of deadly fentanyl as filler, along with other Covid-related factors like increased loneliness and isolation, appear to have helped fuel an increase in overdoses. She sees a <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/epidemic-of-despair-could-haunt-america-long-after-covid\">breakdown in trust</a> as an added stressor in areas where overdoses are high: “Trust in government, trust in media, trust in science, even trust in your own family have been strained&hellip;Families have been torn apart because of different willingness to accept facts.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The pandemic, Monnat notes, has “accelerated a disruption in the social fabric of communities.”

<p>People are feeling lonelier than ever. Even before the pandemics, researchers had begun to focus on the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/\">links between social isolation and loneliness and declining mental health</a>, along with reduced lifespans and heightened risk for disease. Harvard researchers find that older teens and <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/02/young-adults-teens-loneliness-mental-health-coronavirus-covid-pandemic/\">young adults are especially vulnerable</a> to loneliness and isolation. They observe that people this age are particularly in need of a “robust social infrastructure,” which includes supportive connections with schools, doctors, and employers. Since many do not have such infrastructure, the reliance on social media to find a sense of connection increases. Yet <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691617713052\">studies show links between social media use and even more feelings of loneliness</a>, particularly when online interactions replace face-to-face connecting. Recent revelations about Facebook (now changing its name to “Meta”) from whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former employee of the company, show that Facebook was <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20211108/facebook-put-profit-before-public-health\">aware of its negative impact on teen mental health</a> – especially girls -- but did nothing about it.

</p>
<p><strong>The Cost of Ignoring Mental Health</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The costs of mental illness are staggering, in human suffering and in dollars. In the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.milliman.com/-/media/milliman/pdfs/articles/milliman-high-cost-patient-study-2020.ashx\">10% of insured people make up 70% of the total spending on health care</a>. Of that high-cost group, more than half are seeking treatment for behavioral health. Mental health spending is rising <a href=\"https://healthcostinstitute.org/health-care-cost-and-utilization-report/annual-reports\">twice as fast</a> as overall medical spending. Shockingly, nearly half of people seeking treatment for mental distress <a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706714\">get the wrong diagnosis</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 2016, data from the National Health Expenditure Accounts showed that mental disorders were already <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1659\">the most expensive conditions in the U.S. in terms of health care spending</a>&mdash;costing $201 billion. Heart disease, by way of comparison, cost $147 billion, and cancer, $122 billion. Of course, mental health issues and physical ailments like heart disease are often intimately related, so the cost of mental distress is likely even higher when vulnerability to disease is factored in.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>People in mental distress can’t work at optimum levels. The loss of productivity as a result of two of the most common mental disorders, anxiety and depression, costs the global economy US$ <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/promotion-prevention/mental-health-in-the-workplace\">1 trillion each year</a>. Affected employees quit, leading to replacement costs.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It should be clear by now that mental well-being will have to be a higher priority in plans for national and global recovery. It’s encouraging to see positive steps taken in the two stimulus packages, such as increased funds for mental health and substance abuse services, and the push to increase the use of telehealth for mental health services, such as expansions of coverage for such, will be helpful to some sufferers.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Going forward, some of the provisions in the Build Back Better Act (BBB), including investments in public health, child care, Medicaid expansions, and paid leave (a paltry 4 weeks, but better than nothing) will help to ease the strain on some – if they are enacted. The Act allocates $165 million to mental well-being, including $75 million for improving the National Suicide Prevention Line; $50 million for the mental health and substance abuse workforce in addressing the needs of communities of color; $25 million for peer-based programs to support substance abuse treatment; and $15 million for a program to educate school-aged youth about mental health issues. This is good, but it’s not nearly enough. And Thomas Ferguson, Director of Research at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, warns that rapid withdrawal of most Covid support spending, especially for health care, is <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/2020s-knife-edge-election-an-analysis\">likely to make things worse in the near term</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We need to think in terms of more transformative changes to address what is making us so unwell in the first place. Extreme inequalities and the wide range of pathologies generated by an economic model and political system that favors the interests of the wealthy and corporations are not yet being addressed. The priority of wealth for the few over health for the many is upside down. As our anxiety and depression increase, politicians can manipulate us into directing our frustration at various bogeymen, from immigrants to the unemployed. When we feel we have little power in our lives, many turn to guns for an illusory sense of control, creating more dangerous and tense conditions. When we feel disconnected, we may sink further into the unreal worlds of social media and gaming. The coming metaverse looks like a virtual world that <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.com/article/peek-metaverse-prevent-virtual-world-becoming-dystopian-nightmare/1724998\">could swallow us entirely</a>. Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.com/article/peek-metaverse-prevent-virtual-world-becoming-dystopian-nightmare/1724998\">gushes</a> that “creation, avatars, and digital objects are going to be central to how we express ourselves,” but others call it a “<a href=\"https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/\">dystopian nightmare</a>.” It will certainly have profound implications for mental health.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Mental distress is not just personal. It’s collective and political. An inadequate social safety produces mental illness. Income that can’t keep up with inflation causes it. So does a lack of child care and care for the elderly. And feeling like your kids will be worse off than you. Environmental damage and unregulated companies create mental illness. Misguided policies traumatize individuals, families, communities, and ultimately, our entire society.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The pandemic’s impact on mental health was predictable. In October 2020, the American Psychological Association released a <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2021/one-year-pandemic-stress\">report</a> warning of a second pandemic, one of plummeting mental health, that would outlast the virus. What is also predictable is that recovery requires a comprehensive approach to support our mental well-being, individually and collectively.

In the U.S., more than one in four adults was suffering from a diagnosable mental disorder even before the pandemic. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>For too long, cost and access barriers to mental health care have caused incalculable suffering.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Covid has now blown the lid off a crisis building for decades. So why isn’t there a plan to deal with it?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>A Runaway Train Accelerating</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Lancet <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/infographics/covid-mental-health\">reports</a> that cases of mental disorders have skyrocketed during the pandemic, including 53 million new cases of major depressive disorder and 76 million new cases of anxiety disorders. In the U.S., since spring of 2020, the National Center for Health Statistics has partnered with the Census Bureau on a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm\">new, rapid-turnaround data system to monitor depression and anxiety</a>, finding that <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/young-adults-living-alone-report-anxiety-depression-during-pandemic.html\">just over half of adults between the ages of 18 and 44 surveyed have reported symptoms</a>, as have <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/young-adults-living-alone-report-anxiety-depression-during-pandemic.html\">38% of adults living with children</a>. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Researchers find that <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/\">younger adults, racial and ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers (most of them women</a>), have been <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm#:~:text=Younger%20adults%2C%20racial%2F,and%20elevated%20suicidal%20ideation.\">especially hard-hit</a> by mental distress and increased substance use. Growing alcohol use is particularly worrisome among stretched-to-the-breaking-point <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20211123/more-women-drinking-during-pandemic\">young women</a> juggling children under the age of five and work responsibilities. Feedback loops within families mean that distressed parents transfer their anxiety and depression to children and vice versa. Three top U.S. organizations specializing in child and adolescent mental health, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recently declared a <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-a-national-emergency\">state of emergency</a> for the country’s youth, noting that Covid-19 and the ongoing struggle for racial justice have compounded trends of declining mental health among kids observed prior to 2020.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Many people find themselves in so much pain, they <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm#:~:text=Younger%20adults%2C%20racial%2F,and%20elevated%20suicidal%20ideation.\">think about dying</a>. Suicide attempts by young girls are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/teen-girls-suicide-attempts-pandemic-/2021/06/11/567a4f62-cac0-11eb-a11b-6c6191ccd599_story.html\">notably on the rise</a>. Young people unable to obtain mental health care are being sent to hospital emergency rooms, where the staff are <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/er-doctor-private-equity-is-killing-american-healthcare\">under their own intense stress</a> due to private equity takeovers of health care and the spillovers of an inadequate care system. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>We can’t go on like this. Yet as alarming as it all sounds, signs indicate the crisis may only intensify. Covid-19 case rates may be falling in some areas, but the stresses associated with the pandemic are far from over – particularly as new variants spread, causing further disruption.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In the U.S., those needing help face a serious shortage of mental health specialists (themselves often suffering from burnout and stress), a reduced number of psychiatric hospital beds, and a loss of job-based health insurance. Even for those who have insurance, a lack of in-network counselors and therapists means that care is frequently out of reach. And if you don’t live in a city, you may be out of luck: In some states, <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/over-one-third-of-americans-live-in-areas-lacking-mental-health-professionals/\">80% of the population</a> lives in an area where mental health professionals are scarce.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The upshot is that millions are going without the treatment they require. People are unable to sleep, gaining weight, and turning to potentially harmful strategies as they <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2021/one-year-pandemic-stress\">struggle to cope</a> with grief, loss, isolation, family and workplace stress, and economic woes, including the latest <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/experts-on-inflation-prognosis-political-fallout-and-whos-really-to-blame\">worries about inflation</a>.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>A Neurotoxic Virus</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The coronavirus itself attacks the mind. The infected may experience psychological symptoms like brain fog, and for some, the virus is nowhere near done with them after the initial infection. Long-haulers face a <a href=\"https://newsroom.osfhealthcare.org/many-covid-19-long-haulers-experience-mental-health-issues/\">nasty list of potential psychiatric disorders</a>, from phobias to anxiety. Some estimates suggest that as many as one in five people infected with Covid experience such disorders <a href=\"https://newsroom.osfhealthcare.org/many-covid-19-long-haulers-experience-mental-health-issues/\">within three months</a>. They get better, then they get worse, then they get better – up and down on a hellish rollercoaster.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>That’s not all -- <a href=\"https://www.bbrfoundation.org/content/study-reveals-adults-mental-disorders-are-significantly-higher-risk-covid-19-and-have-poorer\">research</a> has shown that those recently diagnosed with a mental disorder were significantly more likely to contract Covid -- and they tended to have worse outcomes than people infected who don't have a mental disorder. Researchers now suspect that having schizophrenia is second only to advanced age as the <a href=\"https://nyulangone.org/news/schizophrenia-second-only-age-greatest-risk-factor-covid-19-death\">highest risk factor for dying of Covid</a>. Nobody knows exactly why.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Viruses have long been <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/virus-connection-how-viruses-affect-psychiatric-pathologies\">linked to mental illness</a>, though just how they relate is not well-understood. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054463/\">As early as 1732</a>, clinicians noted that the flu often came with symptoms like neurasthenia, melancholy, hysteria, mental prostration, and insanity. When Covid hit, researchers looked back at the impact of the Spanish flu and other pandemics on mental health. Available data was scant, but demographer Svenn-Erik Mamelund had studied an increase in asylum hospitalizations from 1872 to 1929, finding that the number of first-time hospitalized patients with mental disorders attributed to influenza rose by an average annual factor of 7.2 in the 6 years following the Spanish flu pandemic. He also found that Spanish flu survivors reported sleep disturbances, depression, mental distraction, dizziness, and difficulties coping at work, and that influenza death rates in the U.S. during the years 1918-1920 were significantly and positively related to suicide rates.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Researchers in Great Britain reported an uptick in various nervous symptoms in patients recovering from Spanish flu infections, including neurasthenia, depression, nerve cell damage, and visual problems. Cases of encephalitis lethargica, an inflammatory central nervous system condition featuring psychotic and catatonic symptoms, also became common – 1 million cases were reported from the beginning of the Spanish flu pandemic in 1916 until the early 1930s. Clinicians surmised a link between the two, though causality is not established. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Spanish flu, and other types of flu, have been linked to psychosis. Early observers of influenza, <a href=\"http://bir.brandeis.edu/bitstream/handle/10192/30986/517%20p-4.pdf?sequence=1\">including Karl Menninger in 1919</a>, noted that people who contracted flu showed a variety of psychotic symptoms, particularly schizophrenia, and theorized that the viruses were neurotoxins. They were onto something. Evidence indicates that <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2778090\">Covid is indeed a neurotoxin</a>.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Over the course of the current pandemic, doctors have seen infected teens <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/10/421666/3-teens-covid-19-developed-sudden-severe-psychiatric-symptoms-why\">suffer sudden psychosis</a>, and researchers are wondering if brain inflammation or immune reactions may account for <a href=\"https://casereports.bmj.com/content/14/4/e242538\">psychotic symptoms</a> in Covid patients with no history of psychiatric complaints.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The coronavirus highlights the insufficiency of an outdated medical perspective separating the mind from the body. Viruses and other things that harm our bodies frequently affect our mental well-being, and vice-versa.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>Social Toxins Spreading</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Like wars and other devastating events, pandemics produce a wide range of mental health issues that hit poor and vulnerable groups especially hard. Covid is no exception.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Researchers Anne Case and Angus Deaton brought the term “deaths of despair” into public awareness with their studies of how mortality rates had risen sharply among certain populations since the 1990s. Their work has highlighted how the impact of stressors tends to widen the gulf between haves and have-nots already affecting the U.S and other countries.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Shannon Monnat of the <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/epidemic-of-despair-could-haunt-america-long-after-covid\">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a> and researchers at the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-human-costs-of-the-pandemic-is-it-time-to-prioritize-well-being/\">Brookings Institute</a> point to increased stress from Covid-19 on populations already facing rising deaths of despair, particularly those in rural areas. Monnat, who tracked deaths of despair related to the opioid crisis prior to the pandemic, has been studying how the coronavirus has been affecting populations of drug users in New York state. She has found that drug supply chain disruptions, including the increased appearance of deadly fentanyl as filler, along with other Covid-related factors like increased loneliness and isolation, appear to have helped fuel an increase in overdoses. She sees a <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/epidemic-of-despair-could-haunt-america-long-after-covid\">breakdown in trust</a> as an added stressor in areas where overdoses are high: “Trust in government, trust in media, trust in science, even trust in your own family have been strained&hellip;Families have been torn apart because of different willingness to accept facts.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The pandemic, Monnat notes, has “accelerated a disruption in the social fabric of communities.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>People are feeling lonelier than ever. Even before the pandemics, researchers had begun to focus on the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/\">links between social isolation and loneliness and declining mental health</a>, along with reduced lifespans and heightened risk for disease.

                                "))) ("Looking for a Libertarian Who’s Not Afraid of History" "<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> opinion section is nothing if not persistent. It rushed to print a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/school-choice-antiracist-history-integration-funding-segregation-11634568700?mod=article_inline\">critique</a> of my detailed, primary source-based <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-milton-friedman-aided-and-abetted-segregationists-in-his-quest-to-privatize-public-education\">study</a> of how Milton Friedman exploited southern resistance to desegregation to promote his ideas for privatizing public education by Phillip W. Magness. But obviously that wasn’t enough. When <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/school-choice-vouchers-virginia-race-racism-desegregation-integration-11634768934\">another scholar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/school-choice-vouchers-milton-friedman-segregation-virginia-maclean-11637192224\">I</a> answered point by point, including in a <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/why-mislead-readers-about-milton-friedman-and-segregation\">longer version on INET’s site</a>, the <em>Journal </em>came back with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/milton-friedman-school-choice-vouchers-virginia-magness-maclean-segregation-integration-11637357604\">yet another screed of his</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The latest response is as insubstantial and factually incorrect as the first one. Let’s begin with his claim that “Rather than engage the economist at his word, Ms. MacLean imputes opportunistic motives to the date of Friedman’s 1955 article on the economic theory of school choice&mdash;one year after <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What my piece actually did was to document how, from 1951 forward, the national press was reporting threats from segregationist officials to turn to private schools if faced with a mandate to desegregate public schools. This renders irrelevant Magness’s suggestion that the pre-<em>Brown</em> timing of Friedman’s drafting of his pro-voucher manifesto is exculpatory on its face. At the same time I was clear that “Whether or not Friedman had Dixie in mind as he drafted his article, he indisputably did all he could to take advantage of the opening created in early 1956 when southern states began ‘massive resistance’ to <em>Brown</em>.”

<p>Friedman’s unpublished correspondence, which I quoted from in the original piece, leaves no doubt about his determination to use the emerging southern white resistance to promote his theory. When Friedman submitted his draft piece in October of 1954, Robert A. Solo, the economist who was editing the collection in which it was to appear, challenged him to consider how it could abet the segregationist cause. Friedman persisted. In answer to Solo’s challenge, Friedman responded that he opposed not only “forced segregation” but also “forced nonsegregation.” That is, he opposed the Supreme Court mandate to integrate southern schools.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Why is that so hard for Magness to admit? After all, Friedman went on to oppose the Civil Rights Act, as did his fellow libertarians. Do their heirs think they can keep such ongoing opposition to anti-discrimination measures a palace secret?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My essay also showed how Friedman found an ally in Leon Dure, a former newspaperman who was then fundraising for two Charlottesville segregation academies and advising southern states on strategy to defy <em>Brown</em> with a better chance of surviving court review. Friedman supplied Dure with ideas he used to win allies to his approach, as well as contacts for his outreach. What does Magness make of those strategy discussions? He doesn’t say; he just ignores them.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Magness then doubles down on his <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/milton-friedman-school-choice-vouchers-virginia-magness-maclean-segregation-integration-11637357604\">fanciful story</a> of the roots of the strategy of “massive resistance” to the Supreme Court order that another researcher had already written to rebut.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The only difference between Virginia’s 1959 tuition grant plan and what Magness refers to as “the arch-segregationist ‘Massive Resistance’ laws of 1956-57” is that the segregationist backers of both&mdash;ultimately the same individuals in key cases--learned they needed to adopt formal color blindness to survive court review. I documented this learning process, aided by Friedman’s economic arguments and Dure’s evangelizing, but Magness, like the proverbial “see no evil” monkey, simply puts his hands over his eyes so he can hold on to his dogma undisturbed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The NAACP, whose Legal Defense and Education Fund led the fight in the courts, consistently opposed the vouchers that Magness speciously claims were “a tool to achieve” integration. If Magness is right about their purpose, why would those in the best position to know fail to see this? And why did the courts come to agree that the vouchers promoted racial segregation and denied equal protection of the law to African American citizens? Magness never even addresses these points, much less explains why anyone should trust him rather than NAACP attorneys such as Virginia’s Oliver Hill and federal judges.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Milton Friedman himself ignored six years of mounting evidence of the segregationist impact of vouchers between 1956 and the 1962 publication of <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>, in which he recommended the Virginia Plan, acknowledging that the state government aimed “to avoid racial integration” (p. 100, n. 5; also 118). So, why does Magness call me “brazen” and “conspiratorial” and engaged in “smearing” for sharing this indisputable history?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It’s time that Friedman’s admirers, the <em>Journal</em>’s opinion page, and the many supporters of diverting tax revenues from public education to private schools come to terms with the real history of their cause. They seem to imagine that sound defense requires belligerent denial of the factual record. Is any cause served by such blind faith?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Again, I ask Mr. Magness’s fellow libertarians: is even one of you willing to examine this history without defensiveness but instead with due recognition of the need for honest reckoning?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The disastrous consequences of segregation and the many efforts to revive it for political gain are, I hope, obvious. It’s time libertarians give up disinformation as a strategy of dealing with troubling matters. They could start by grappling seriously with their history in regard to race and education.<a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/admin/entries/blog/22009-looking-for-a-libertarian-whos-not-afraid-of-history#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>

                                    <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> opinion section is nothing if not persistent. It rushed to print a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/school-choice-antiracist-history-integration-funding-segregation-11634568700?mod=article_inline\">critique</a> of my detailed, primary source-based <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-milton-friedman-aided-and-abetted-segregationists-in-his-quest-to-privatize-public-education\">study</a> of how Milton Friedman exploited southern resistance to desegregation to promote his ideas for privatizing public education by Phillip W. Magness. But obviously that wasn’t enough. When <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/school-choice-vouchers-virginia-race-racism-desegregation-integration-11634768934\">another scholar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/school-choice-vouchers-milton-friedman-segregation-virginia-maclean-11637192224\">I</a> answered point by point, including in a <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/why-mislead-readers-about-milton-friedman-and-segregation\">longer version on INET’s site</a>, the <em>Journal </em>came back with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/milton-friedman-school-choice-vouchers-virginia-magness-maclean-segregation-integration-11637357604\">yet another screed of his</a>.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The latest response is as insubstantial and factually incorrect as the first one. Let’s begin with his claim that “Rather than engage the economist at his word, Ms. MacLean imputes opportunistic motives to the date of Friedman’s 1955 article on the economic theory of school choice&mdash;one year after <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.” 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>What my piece actually did was to document how, from 1951 forward, the national press was reporting threats from segregationist officials to turn to private schools if faced with a mandate to desegregate public schools. This renders irrelevant Magness’s suggestion that the pre-<em>Brown</em> timing of Friedman’s drafting of his pro-voucher manifesto is exculpatory on its face. At the same time I was clear that “Whether or not Friedman had Dixie in mind as he drafted his article, he indisputably did all he could to take advantage of the opening created in early 1956 when southern states began ‘massive resistance’ to <em>Brown</em>.”
</p>
<p> 
</p>

"<p>Unconventional monetary policies after the financial crisis have been extensively discussed and analyzed, with the notable exception of the collateral policies at their core. The work by Kjell Nyborg is a rare exception. On the basis of an in-depth analysis of the collateral policies pursued by the European Central Bank in the wake of the financial crisis, he argues that those policies aggravated the sovereign debt crisis and put the survival of the euro at risk. Nyborg’s analysis of collateral policy is an important contribution to the literature, but his critique of the ECB’s crisis response is misguided. Moreover, his proposal to retailor haircuts on central bank liquidity in a manner that would deepen the ECB's role in the fiscal disciplining of member states is dangerous: if adopted, it would be profoundly procyclical and destabilizing. Our <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/admin/entries/paper/22034-central-banks-caught-between-market-liquidity-and-fiscal-disciplining-a-money-view-perspective-on-collateral-policy\">new INET Working Paper</a> analyses Kjell Nyborg’s work to identify a set of collateral policy principles that likely will ameliorate impending market liquidity crises as opposed to exacerbating them.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>What is the role of collateral policy?</h4>
<p>Central banking is widely seen as first and foremost a matter of using interest rates to achieve monetary policy goals. Central banks lend not merely at a cost, however, but always against securities. Borrowers pledge assets to access central bank funding. In this sense, the lending is secured. While secured lending exists in many forms, one feature is a constant: what is accepted as collateral varies significantly over time.
</p>
<p>What the European Central Bank (ECB) accepted as collateral before and after the financial crisis were two altogether different things. When money and credit markets are liquid and well-functioning, central banks take a conservative approach, accepting only high-quality assets as collateral. In periods of market stress, on the other hand, they usually respond by accepting a wider range of assets as eligible collateral.
</p>
<p>Overall, three core factors define the contours of central bank collateral policies. First, eligibility criteria set out what assets are eligible as collateral when banks seek access to central bank money; second, haircuts determine how much central bank money a bank will receive (as a percentage of the market value of the collateral) for different types of eligible collateral; and third, stipulations on counterparty access define what types of financial institutions the central bank is willing to provide lending to.
</p>
<p>The haircut can be seen as the central banks’ insurance against liquidity risk. Should the borrower be unable to pay back the loan, the central bank can avoid a net loss, even if it has to sell the collateral at a price below the original market value. In this sense, haircuts are a risk management technique for central banks. Since the global financial crisis, it has become apparent, however, that haircuts have important implications for liquidity in the markets where collateral trades.
</p>
<p>Since most collateral in the Eurozone is issued by Member States, the ECB’s collateral policy has significant impacts on liquidity and price in sovereign bond markets – that is, ECB’s collateral policy has significant, if deeply underappreciated, fiscal spillovers. In the early stages of the crisis, spreads between German bonds and ‘periphery’ Eurozone countries were amplified by the ECB’s collateral policy.
</p>
<h4>What is wrong with Nyborg’s critique of the ECB’s collateral policy?</h4>
<p>The main message of Nyborg’s book is that the terms on which ECB supplied money for collateral during the crisis were “overly generous.” We argue that Nyborg’s characterization of the ECB's collateral policy is highly misleading, however. In fact, haircuts were increased several times for assets with low credit ratings. Moreover, haircut differentials – the spread between haircuts on collateral assets with a high and a low credit rating – widened, hence producing a contractionary rather than an expansionary effect on collateral space.
</p>
<p>Before October 2008, the ECB applied identical haircuts to all European government debt. There was no distinction between high- and low-quality collateral in this asset class. After the collapse of Lehman, the haircuts on highly-rated government debt remained at the same level, while all lower-rated government debt was assigned haircuts 5 percentage points higher.
</p>
<p>Overall, three observations about changes made by the ECB to its haircut schedule stand out. First, haircuts for high-quality collateral were kept low throughout the crisis (and even declining for longer residual maturities). Second, for government bonds with a low credit rating, the opposite trend prevailed. Assets with a low rating faced a dramatic increase in haircuts, in the range of 550 to 850 basis points (depending on residual maturities), seen over the full period. Third, the haircut spread – between assets with a low (B to BBB-) and a high credit rating (A to AAA) – jumped 500 basis points in October 2008, was unaffected by the January 2011 revision, but increased again in October 2013, with 50 to 400 basis points (depending on residual maturities). For short residual maturities, the haircut spread jumped by 50 basis points (from 500 to 550), while for long residual maturities it increased by 400 basis points (from 500 to 900).
</p>
<p>Over the full period, haircuts on government bonds with a low credit rating and residual maturity of less than one year were increased 12-fold, from 0.5% to 6%, whereas haircuts for the same class of government bonds with a residual maturity of 7-10 years nearly tripled, from 4.5 % to 13 %. These are hardly trivial increases.
</p>
<p>We suggest that the haircut changes do not match their depiction by Nyborg as “overly generous”. On the contrary, it is difficult to imagine that haircut increases at this scale did not add to the already severe liquidity strains of troubled banks and governments in distressed countries.
</p>
<h4>What’s the way forward for collateral policy?</h4>
<p>In Nyborg’s view, future instances of over-borrowing by banks and sovereigns ought to be prevented by using haircuts in a punitive manner. “The idea is simple,” he says, “if a debt-to-GDP ratio of no more than 60 percent is desired,” all you need to do is “increase haircuts progressively in the debt-to-GDP ratio beyond this.” The same mechanism can be established for fiscal deficits, such that haircuts are increased progressively as fiscal deficits exceed agreed thresholds. “My proposal works,” explains Nyborg, “by reducing the liquidity and value of a highly indebted country’s bonds.” By increasing borrowing costs, the “appetite” for borrowing in excess of agreed thresholds should recede.
</p>
<p>We strongly oppose Nyborg’s proposal. If haircuts were proportional to fiscal deficits and public debt to GDP, collateral policies would exert a pro-cyclical and destabilizing influence not just on collateral markets, but on the financial systems they anchor. For a central bank to combat a market liquidity crisis effectively, it must decrease haircuts, not increase them – and more so for assets with low ratings, such that haircut differentials narrow rather than widen. This is essential to market liquidity. Incidentally, it is also by far the best risk management strategy, because the need for liquidity injections and asset purchases will be much more speedily satisfied with this policy mix.
</p>
<p>Our Working paper argues that the ECB's ambivalent strategy – of providing liquidity but raising haircuts on distressed assets – did not amount to “lending freely, against any and all collateral that is good in normal times”, as we believe Bagehot’s rule advises. By expanding collateral eligibility but raising haircuts and haircut differentials, the ECB was undermining the market liquidity it was trying to restore. To stop collateral valuation spirals, central banks must lower haircuts and haircut differentials – and suspend rather than follow the collateral valuation practices of financial markets.
</p>
<h4>Should we hold back for fears of moral hazard?</h4>
<p>Countercyclical collateral policies are likely to be subjected to a standard criticism against measures that ease access to central bank liquidity. Such policies cause a moral hazard for both governments and banks, who would get access to funding on “subsidized” terms. Notably, lowering haircuts on central bank liquidity would amount to encouragement of “overborrowing” by banks that might in fact be insolvent and hence should <em>not</em> receive central bank funding.
</p>
<p>Against such objections, we suggest that one must first acknowledge that liquidity provision and moral hazard are best dealt with separately. In much the same way as it would be “a terrible mistake”, in the words of Paul de Grauwe, if a central bank were to “abandon its role of lender of last resort in the banking sector because there is a risk of moral hazard”, we suggest that compromising collateral expansion by raising haircuts is a highly unfortunate conflation of strategies. The point is not that moral hazard problems should be ignored; only that they should be addressed differently. The solvency of individual banks is a task for micro-prudential regulation and supervision, not a concern that should be held against collateral policies designed to ease a market liquidity crisis.
</p>
<p>Research has established that the moral hazard effects of liquidity provision are less detrimental than those resulting from direct recapitalizations of banks, the dominant response to bank insolvencies. The upshot is, we argue, that even if the main objective is to reduce moral hazard issues in banks to the largest possible extent, lowering haircuts likely will in fact contribute positively. By helping abate the liquidity crisis, incidences of banks becoming insolvent are reduced, and hence moral hazard in its severest form is minimized.

Notably, lowering haircuts on central bank liquidity would amount to encouragement of “overborrowing” by banks that might in fact be insolvent and hence should <em>not</em> receive central bank funding.
</p>
<p>Against such objections, we suggest that one must first acknowledge that liquidity provision and moral hazard are best dealt with separately. In much the same way as it would be “a terrible mistake”, in the words of Paul de Grauwe, if a central bank were to “abandon its role of lender of last resort in the banking sector because there is a risk of moral hazard”, we suggest that compromising collateral expansion by raising haircuts is a highly unfortunate conflation of strategies. The point is not that moral hazard problems should be ignored; only that they should be addressed differently. The solvency of individual banks is a task for micro-prudential regulation and supervision, not a concern that should be held against collateral policies designed to ease a market liquidity crisis.
</p>
<p>Research has established that the moral hazard effects of liquidity provision are less detrimental than those resulting from direct recapitalizations of banks, the dominant response to bank insolvencies. The upshot is, we argue, that even if the main objective is to reduce moral hazard issues in banks to the largest possible extent, lowering haircuts likely will in fact contribute positively. By helping abate the liquidity crisis, incidences of banks becoming insolvent are reduced, and hence moral hazard in its severest form is minimized.

</p>
<p>Historically novel events cause the processes driving stock market returns to change in unforeseeable ways. This kind of instability famously eludes representation in terms of standard probability theory, which relies on past data. To deal with so-called “radical” or “Knightian” uncertainty, market participants rely on narrative dynamics to help give shape and contextual meaning to novel events as relationships change in real-time.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is the essence of the Novelty-Narrative Hypothesis (NNH) that I assess in my new book, <em>How Novelty and Narratives Drive the Stock Market: Black Swans, Animal Spirits and Scapegoat</em>s published as part of <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/research-books\">INET’s book series with Cambridge University Press</a>. This new approach enables researchers, policy-makers, and investors alike to better understand stock market outcomes and confront unforeseeable change and the Knightian uncertainty it engenders with real-world observations and scientific scrutiny. Standard economics relies on probabilistic rules which presume that the future is an exact replica of the past and, as such, is unable to deal with “true” uncertainty. NNH offers a way forward.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Why is change in stock market relationships unforeseeable? Frank Knight famously traced the answer to events that are to some extent historically unique. The last two years perfectly illustrate Knight’s point. Financial markets have had to grapple with an unprecedented pandemic, historic US Congressional stimulus, dramatic supply chain disruptions, and sharp pivots toward more remote forms of both labor and commerce. Simultaneously, there has been an oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, the arrival of a new US presidential administration, shifting geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, and, now, substantive talk of Federal Reserve tapering in the face of creeping inflation. Such events catalyze change in business processes and in the economy’s overall structure. Yet, true uncertainty implies that no one can foresee when such events would occur or, more importantly, how their impacts on future returns are interpreted by market participants at a given point in time.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My book offers the first comprehensive analysis of the role that stories play when novel events cause instability in the stock market. Stories are visceral, contagious, and ever-evolving. Stories share a living symbiotic relationship with the people and communities that tell them. Stories reflect a society’s culture, values, institutions, experiences, diversity, and politics. Stories are the consequence of uncertainty, but also serve as a source of uncertainty themselves. Stories are the currency of uncertainty. People tell stories that others have told them and major events are often the catalysts for many of the most popular story threads coursing through our minds, discussions, news reports, business communications, and social media feeds.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Macro shocks, however, do not occur in isolation. Rather, large-scale non-repetitive events often spill over into a churning stream of novelty at the firm level, think bankruptcies, management shake-ups, legal issues, M&As, new production processes, and so on. What’s more, the interpreted impacts of macro shocks on firm outcomes may be quite ambiguous; often, the distinction lies with short- versus longer-run return forecasts and the accompanying narrative links versus established story threads, respectively.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My book relies on a novel dataset based on millions of identified unscheduled corporate events across the universe of <em>Dow Jones</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>MarketWatch</em>, and <em>Barron’s</em> financial news reports over the last two decades. I assess the intensity of narrative dynamics through big data analysis of event novelty, inertia, sentiment, and relevance. These metrics are then interacted to show how narrative intensity aligns with formal structural breaks in posited relationships driving returns, volatility, and fund flows. Interestingly, the narrative dynamics of firm-level events correspond rather closely with macro event narratives. But the empirical evidence shows that macro unscheduled events spill over onto future corporate novelty triggering different forms of stock market instability.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Narrative economics is a popular and growing field of research. Unlike other treatments of narrative dynamics in the stock market, my book places psychology in a rational setting of cognitive decision-making under uncertainty. Evidence from other social sciences supporting a rational view of sentiment is overwhelming. What’s more, my book does not trace the source of narrative dynamics to random chance, evolutionary biology, or psychological disorders, as others have contended. Rather, NNH implies that narrative dynamics stem from historically unique events and the unforeseeable structural change they engender in stock market relationships. Put differently, my book advances the view that the role of novelty and narratives reflects the normal state of affairs in inherently unstable asset markets. Consequently, my book breaks away from mechanistic models of contagion used to describe narratives’ impact on market outcomes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The missing link to deal with inherent instability and uncertainty is narrative dynamics. Story threads are the primary source of soft information for researchers, policy-makers, regulators, and market participants alike. This year, we are witnessing an evolving interplay between the narratives of inflation pressures and narratives following Chair Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee. Yields on 10-year Treasury Notes increased from 1% in February 2021 to over 1.5% through June. Google Trends searches for “Jerome Powell” spiked in March as yields increased. Google Trends searches for “inflation” began to rise in April 2021 and peaked in May. There appears a connection between the stories individuals are participating in and the outcomes observed in financial markets.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In March of 2021, billionaire investor Ray Dalio claimed that “investing in bonds has become stupid.” He has publicly reiterated this view on September 21 which prompted the following <em>Bloomberg News</em> interview query posed to Michelle Seitz, CEO of Russell Investments: “A very common theme here has been 'don’t buy bonds’ ever since Ray Dalio said it (again this morning) and you have said the same. So where do you go?” Are narrative dynamics at play here? Was there an underlying market event that aligned with the timing of the comments? Was Dalio or Seitz providing a narrative link that extends an established story thread or were they cultivating a new narrative angle? Narrative analytics would explore the emotional intensity of the surrounding linguistic context. It would track the stories’ visibility and mileage observed by the general public and by financial institutions. Narrative analytics would investigate the possible contagion and propagation of the view by other major investment figures and personalities. And, narrative analytics would always keep in mind the time-series behaviors of these metrics and their interaction as many other events unfold simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The toolkit under NNH can be used in myriad ways by researchers and policy-makers for informing financial market decisions under uncertainty. For example, investigators might consider tracking the narrative attributes surrounding unscheduled events mentioned in 10-K and 8-K corporate statements, IPO prospecti, or in the SEC disclosures of Venture Capital firms. By tracking the way CEOs and other executives discuss particular issues on their shareholder calls or through other investor relations, dynamics of firm-level and industry narratives could be revealed. Which subsets of soft information are they emphasizing? How are they framing the soft information? NNH offers an empirical, pragmatic framework for addressing these questions and many more.

"<p>David Graeber, the electrifying social thinker who helped spark the Occupy Movement and challenged our acceptance of crippling debt and bullshit jobs, died at the age of fifty-nine in 2020. Lucky for us, he left a parting gift completed just three weeks before his death -- something as expansive, fresh, and invigorating as his mind.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thought-provoking and even thrilling, <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374157357/thedawnofeverything\">The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity</a>, co-authored with archaeologist David Wengrow, weaves a tale of human history unlike anything you’ve read before. Erudite, witty, and rigorous, the book complicates, if not outright smashes, what we thought we knew about <em>homo sapiens’</em> 200,000-year journey on Earth so far. This is a book that playfully spins us around with new insights until we are dizzy with possibilities.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As we hunger for something -- anything -- to lift us from the grim suspicion that humanity is destined to burn, crash, or fade away in lonely desolation, Graeber has laid out a sumptuous feast for thought. Let’s dive in.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Past, Revisited</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>First consideration: We don’t see others as they are, but load them up with our own assumptions, fantasies, and biases. We do it to our neighbors, and we do it to our remote human ancestors who aren’t around to argue with us – those funny-looking people in western civ textbooks who supposedly march through orderly stages of development, finally arriving at what we call “civilization.” During the Enlightenment, this history-in-stages approach grew popular with intellectuals like Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose fanciful armchair speculations about how we got to where we are soon became taken as facts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You were meant to pick a team – either Team Hobbes (all was brutish and nasty until kings and cops beat us into submission) or Team Rousseau (we were happy innocents until the Agricultural Revolution saddled us with sad but inevitable property and inequality). Thence you could assemble the kind of social science narrative that has dominated our thinking in one form or another ever since, most recently in Noah Harari’s smash-hit “Sapiens” (Team Rousseau).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Like all origin stories, these tales lodged in our collective psyches explain us to ourselves. And like all origin stories, they conceal as much as they reveal.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte asked, “What is history but a fable agreed upon?” Graeber and Wengrow come in to shake off the spell of prevailing fables -- not as armchair theorists snatching ideas from thin air but as reviewers and synthesizers of a plethora of tantalizing recent discoveries, along with the work of neglected thinkers who (hello, feminist scholars) who drew ire for their attention to glaring inconsistencies in the established narratives. In doing so, they recover frameworks for the way ancient peoples experienced their world that help us to see that we could be organizing ourselves – socially, economically, politically -- on principles much different from those that seem inevitable today. This is heartening.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Among the propositions of Graeber and Wengrow are these:
</p>
<p>
</p>

</p>
<p>The authors begin by pointing out that eighteenth-century theories of human history were partly a reaction to critiques of European society offered by indigenous observers. Consider Kandiaronk, a Wendat chief so skilled in debate he could easily shut down a Jesuit, who blew the minds of listeners with penetrating insights on authority, decency, social responsibility, and above all, freedom. Kandiaronk’s critiques, presented in a dialogue form by the Baron de Lahontan in 1703, sparked a whole genre of books voicing criticisms from a “primitive” outsider. Graeber and Wengrow illuminate how profoundly these products influenced Enlightenment thought and helped give rise to social and political experiments (including the U.S. Constitution), as well as defensive strategies to discount such perspectives (also including the U.S. Constitution).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Madame de Graffigny’s epistolary novel of 1747, “Letters from a Peruvian Woman” (1747) tells the story of an Incan princess who rails against the inequality she observes in French society – particularly the ill-treatment of women. This volume, in turn, helped shape the thinking of the economist A.R.J. Turgot, who responded by insisting that inequality was inevitable. He outlined a theory of social evolution posited as progress from hunters to pastoralism to farming to urban commercial civilization that placed anybody not at the final stage as a vestigial life form that had better get with the program. Turgot’s scheme of social evolution started popping up in lectures of his buddy Adam Smith over in Glasgow, and eventually worked its way into general theories of human history proposed by several of Smith’s influential colleagues such as Adam Ferguson.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The new default paradigm formed the lens through which Europeans viewed indigenous peoples the world over; namely as childish innocents or brutal savages living in deplorable static conditions. Everybody was to be sorted according to how they acquired food, with egalitarian foraging societies banished to the bottom of the ladder. The Kandiaronks causing anxiety by pointing out the grotesque conditions of so-called civilization -- from the large numbers of starving people to the need for two hours for a Frenchman to dress himself -- could now be dismissed. This mindset became prevalent in the emerging field of archaeology, where practitioners churned out biased interpretations of ancient societies that rendered them non-threatening to the modern, capitalist way of life.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Teleological history was the name of the game, and scholars played it endlessly.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Archaeologists fixated on what looked “civilized” to them -- mainly large, stratified societies like Pharaonic Egypt, Imperial Rome, Aztec Mexico, Han China, or ancient Greece – the kinds of places where you get big monuments (archaeologists can easily study these), authoritarian rulers, and plenty of violence, usually accompanied by the subordination of women. This construct of civilization rests on the idea of sacrifice: we must give up basic freedoms, like the freedom to object to nonsensical orders, if we want the touted benefits. Maybe we should even give up life itself if the gods or the rulers say it must be so. We can see this today in our own society, with low-wage workers expected to sacrifice themselves for the gods of the market. (Females are deemed especially suitable offerings).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There is definitely something wrong with this picture. Whether you’re a young girl snatched up to serve an Aztec emperor or a woman used as a breeding machine by Texan politicians, “civilization” is not really working for you.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Graeber and Wengrow try to shed the bad habits of their colleagues by presenting multi-dimensional portraits of ancient peoples, going all the way back to the Stone Age, that make them appear less exotic and truer to life. We see them playing, preening, working, and arguing with one another. They build and blunder. They try new things, then toss them aside. Some create societies that are fair-minded and generous, others that are domineering and violent. All are trying to figure out how to live better, and often screwing up. The new narrative that emerges shows that flexibility, experimentation, and a drive to live with dignity and joy are a bigger part of our human heritage than we ever realized.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Graeber and Wengrow posit that certain basic freedoms, like the freedom to move away from a society that doesn’t suit you, or to disobey orders, were seen as precious in many ancient societies&mdash;particularly the ones that archaeologists haven’t known quite how to categorize. And these values didn’t disappear the first time somebody planted a crop. The authors provide copious evidence that just because a society feeds itself one way doesn’t mean that a particular social organization or orientation automatically follows.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The familiar story of human social evolution holds that foraging societies were little more than the prelude to the Agricultural Revolution, which purportedly changed everything. The picture was supposed to look like this: Foragers were mobile; farmers were sedentary. Foragers collected food; farmers produced it. Foragers didn’t have private property; farmers did. Foragers were innately egalitarian; farmers stratified. If social scientists found evidence of people who didn’t live by agriculture behaving differently from this formula, they were described as “emergent” or “deviant.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But Graeber and Wengrow make a strong case that none of this is actually supported by the evidence. They highlight how in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, for example, there was never any “switch” from Paleolithic forager to Neolithic farmer. The transition from living mainly on wild resources to a life based on food production actually took place over 3,000 years – hardly a revolutionary timeframe. And while the authors acknowledge that agriculture allowed for the possibility of more unequal concentrations of wealth, in most cases this only began to happen millennia after farming got going. In the centuries before, people were effectively trying farming out, switching between modes of production, hunting a bit here, growing a bit there. Changing things up as new conditions emerged. Concentrations of wealth sometimes occurred, but other times they didn’t.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What looked like a static picture of the past starts to shift into a colorful kaleidoscope.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The authors argue that instead of an Agricultural Revolution, our ancestors engaged in a lengthy and complex process that didn’t lead to neat categories of social and political structures. They point out that in the Fertile Crescent, some people who were not dependent on agriculture could be quite stratified and violent, while others in neighboring farming areas look much more egalitarian, with women enjoying pronounced social and economic visibility.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There’s no reason, say the authors, to assume that agriculture in remote periods meant private land ownership, territoriality, or a no-return passage from hierarchical arrangements.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They point to Amazonia during the Holocene period, where a “playful tradition” of farming meant that people spent the rainy season in villages growing stuff in a rather haphazard way and living communally, and then abandoned their homes during the dry season to hunt and fish under an autocratic structure, only to start it all over somewhere else the next year. There was no clear line between domestic and non-domestic animals, but something more like traveling zoos of tamed forest creatures that went along with humans for the ride. Instead of a refuge of solitary peoples, Amazonia emerges as home to people with wide, intricate networks over vast distances and flexible arrangements that are difficult to study because they didn’t leave behind tax records and monuments. Amazonians didn’t do agriculture the way the standard narrative says they should for a simple reason: they didn’t have to. Food was abundant enough, and strategies to access it smart enough, that there wasn’t any reason to pick up a hoe or confine yourself to one place.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Farming,” argue Graeber and Wengrow, “often started out as an economy of deprivation; which is why it tended to happen first in areas where wild resources were thinnest on the ground.” In other words, agriculture was the odd-person-out strategy for survival for much of human history. Its practitioners seem much more prevalent in the past because they built mud houses and stayed in place, thus leaving behind more visible signs.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Graeber and Wengrow point out that it has taken a long time for scholars – let’s face it, mostly white, male, western scholars -- to understand evidence under their noses because they couldn’t help projecting themselves backward in time. They looked at a Mayan wall mural and saw a jumble of fantastic creatures rather than a storytelling device that provided detailed information in lieu of writing. They gazed on curvy female figurines and imagined that such bodies could only be valuable for their fertility, rather than understanding that those curves were sagging breasts and rolls of fat representing the bodies of elder women in high political positions. Because “writing” in fantastic painted beasts and valuing older women with authority were alien concepts, scholars just made stuff up.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Blindness to the contributions of women has been a particular blight on our ability to see human history clearly. As the authors note (and many a feminist scholar could have told you), social scientists analyzing early cities and “mega-sites” have tended to concentrate particular types of cultural development, like the easily-visible knowledge of building pyramids or collecting taxes. But the knowledge of cooking and healing, far less visible, (though much more critical to survival), associated with the activities of women, got demoted far beneath the knowledge of things like how to wage war on somebody. More peaceful societies that emphasized the former were misunderstood and ignored.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Graeber and Wengrow show that if we look with fresh eyes, we can see an abundance of ancient cities where even the most autocratic rulers are answerable to town councils and assemblies, many of them affording women equal status. Democracy, in their narrative, isn’t something that sprung up out of ancient Greece fully formed like Athena, but part of a heritage of ideas of governance along egalitarian lines that appeared over and over among ancient peoples. Some ancient cities developed an aristocratic ethos and favored charismatic authority figures, but others didn’t, even quite large ones. Interestingly, the “heroic” type of settlements appear to come after, and in reaction to, the more egalitarian cities. The authors discuss a theory of how settlements with entirely different social and political structures often arise in close proximity, suggesting the influence of “schismogenesis” – a sort of competitive relationship between groups of people that drive them to identify as opposite of each other (think Sparta and Athens).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Graeber and Wengrow suggest that it was by this process of schismogenesis that we got cities ruled by kings instead of councils: “Aristocracies, perhaps monarchy itself, first emerged in opposition to the egalitarian cities of the Mesopotamian plans,” they write.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The case Teotihuacan is one of the most vivid examples in the book of how different things look when scholars put biases aside. The largest urban center of Mesoamerica before the Aztecs, which peaked at about 100,000 people, Teotihuacan had autocratic overlords -- but then got rid of them. What looked first to scholars like a static city dominated by monumental buildings and human sacrifice (an indication of powerful rulers and stratification) turns out to have abandoned this structure to focus on shared governance and top-quality public housing, possibly after some kind of revolution. At first, archaeologists took the fancy apartments of Teotihuacan to be palaces, but now it’s clear that most of the city’s residents lived in digs with drainage facilities, beautifully plastered floors and walls, and attractive communal spaces decorated with murals. Evidence of diets indicates that most everyone was eating well. But since the Teotihuacans didn’t leave written evidence, it has taken a long time for scholars to imagine a city likely organized by local assemblies answerable to a governing council where everybody expected to live well.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>OK, so what?</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If we’re really honest, what passes for civilization today is frequently a system of dominance and deprivation for most people, and one that would have repelled many of our ancestors. Far from living in conditions that maximize our freedom and wellbeing, we struggle with inequality, distrust, powerlessness, and disillusionment. In the world’s richest country, a lot of us can’t even afford a doctor when we’re sick.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Graeber and Wengrow define the modern state, which most of us live in, as a political structure that combines at least two common forms of domination: control of violence, control of information, and dominance via personal charisma (see: American elections). They are societies where power is not widely shared, and where the values of caring and cooperation are emphasized far less than those of competition and possessing more than your neighbor.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The many forms of freedom and enjoyment that early humans obviously deemed essential to life are not accessible to the vast majority. Who can travel about freely with minimal vacation time and insufficient funds? Who can freely reject conditions that don’t suit them? Who can refuse the arbitrary commands that bombard us daily (pay for this crappy service, take this shitty job, do what this racist cop tells you to do)? No one but the very affluent.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It’s really hard to imagine it can be any other way because for the last couple thousand years, most of us have lived under kings or emperors, or, where those didn’t exist, patriarchy or other forms of violent domination. Graeber and Wengrow acknowledge that once established, these structures are hard to get rid of – especially in our mental habits.
</p>
<p>
But a close look at the diversity and richness of our human history ought to help us to gather the courage to reimagine how life can be better and to put these visions into action. Hints of social possibilities dropped in from the remote past can inspire us with the knowledge that we do not have to accept being bullied by tyrants or plutocrats. By bringing the there and then into the here and now, we can consider that unequal, warlike, patriarchal societies are not the human norm, and are far from normal. Just like our forebearers, we can make choices.</p>" "//www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/is-the-doom-of-humanity-really-inevitable-maybe-not" (25044 39276) new 1 nil nil ((title nil "Is the Doom of Humanity Really Inevitable?

                                    <p>David Graeber, the electrifying social thinker who helped spark the Occupy Movement and challenged our acceptance of crippling debt and bullshit jobs, died at the age of fifty-nine in 2020. Lucky for us, he left a parting gift completed just three weeks before his death -- something as expansive, fresh, and invigorating as his mind.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Thought-provoking and even thrilling, <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374157357/thedawnofeverything\">The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity</a>, co-authored with archaeologist David Wengrow, weaves a tale of human history unlike anything you’ve read before. Erudite, witty, and rigorous, the book complicates, if not outright smashes, what we thought we knew about <em>homo sapiens’</em> 200,000-year journey on Earth so far. This is a book that playfully spins us around with new insights until we are dizzy with possibilities.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>As we hunger for something -- anything -- to lift us from the grim suspicion that humanity is destined to burn, crash, or fade away in lonely desolation, Graeber has laid out a sumptuous feast for thought. Let’s dive in.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>Past, Revisited</strong>
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>First consideration: We don’t see others as they are, but load them up with our own assumptions, fantasies, and biases. We do it to our neighbors, and we do it to our remote human ancestors who aren’t around to argue with us – those funny-looking people in western civ textbooks who supposedly march through orderly stages of development, finally arriving at what we call “civilization.” During the Enlightenment, this history-in-stages approach grew popular with intellectuals like Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose fanciful armchair speculations about how we got to where we are soon became taken as facts.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>You were meant to pick a team – either Team Hobbes (all was brutish and nasty until kings and cops beat us into submission) or Team Rousseau (we were happy innocents until the Agricultural Revolution saddled us with sad but inevitable property and inequality). Thence you could assemble the kind of social science narrative that has dominated our thinking in one form or another ever since, most recently in Noah Harari’s smash-hit “Sapiens” (Team Rousseau).
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Like all origin stories, these tales lodged in our collective psyches explain us to ourselves. And like all origin stories, they conceal as much as they reveal.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte asked, “What is history but a fable agreed upon?” Graeber and Wengrow come in to shake off the spell of prevailing fables -- not as armchair theorists snatching ideas from thin air but as reviewers and synthesizers of a plethora of tantalizing recent discoveries, along with the work of neglected thinkers who (hello, feminist scholars) who drew ire for their attention to glaring inconsistencies in the established narratives. In doing so, they recover frameworks for the way ancient peoples experienced their world that help us to see that we could be organizing ourselves – socially, economically, politically -- on principles much different from those that seem inevitable today. This is heartening.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Among the propositions of Graeber and Wengrow are these:
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<ul><li>We barely have the language to express what our remote ancestors were up to 95% of the time.</li><li>The Agricultural Revolution wasn’t a revolution at all. The real story is much more complex – and interesting.</li><li>Ancient peoples lived with a rich variety of social and political structures, even varying according to the season. (Very flexible, those folks).</li><li>Humans aren’t just pawns on a chessboard of material conditions.

Ditto, patriarchy.</li><li>Past societies that valued women were happier places to live. (Duh).</li><li>We can do better. We have done better.</li></ul>

Who can travel about freely with minimal vacation time and insufficient funds? Who can freely reject conditions that don’t suit them? Who can refuse the arbitrary commands that bombard us daily (pay for this crappy service, take this shitty job, do what this racist cop tells you to do)? No one but the very affluent.

<p>It’s really hard to imagine it can be any other way because for the last couple thousand years, most of us have lived under kings or emperors, or, where those didn’t exist, patriarchy or other forms of violent domination. Graeber and Wengrow acknowledge that once established, these structures are hard to get rid of – especially in our mental habits.

But a close look at the diversity and richness of our human history ought to help us to gather the courage to reimagine how life can be better and to put these visions into action. Hints of social possibilities dropped in from the remote past can inspire us with the knowledge that we do not have to accept being bullied by tyrants or plutocrats. By bringing the there and then into the here and now, we can consider that unequal, warlike, patriarchal societies are not the human norm, and are far from normal. Just like our forebearers, we can make choices.</p>
