When he asked if that was the case &#x201C;even with the weather like this,&#x201D; a manager said yes, he said.</p> <p>Employees at the candle factory heard tornado warning sirens hours before the tornado hit, and were ushered in bathrooms and hallways for safety, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kentucky-tornado-factory-workers-threatened-firing-left-tornado-employ-rcna8581\" target=\"_blank\">according to a report Monday by NBC News</a>. But after the first warning had passed, they were told to go back to work&#x2014;and some were rebuffed when they attempted to leave, according to several workers who spoke with NBC News.</p> <p>As many as 15 workers asked to be let go so they could get home but their requests were denied, according to five employees of the candle factory who spoke with NBC News.</p> <p>One of them was McKayla Emery, 21, who was seriously injured in the tornado and hospitalized after being hit in the head by concrete, suffering from chemical burns and damaged kidneys. Emery told NBC News she heard a supervisor tell four workers: &#x201C;If you leave, you&#x2019;re more than likely to be fired.&#x201D;</p> <h2>&#x2018;Absolutely untrue&#x2019;</h2> <p>The company denied the allegations that workers were forced to stay at the factory or threatened with their jobs if they left.</p> <p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s absolutely untrue,&#x201D; spokesman Bob Ferguson told NBC News. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had a policy in place since COVID began. Employees can leave any time they want to leave and they can come back the next day.&#x201D;</p> <p>The factory, where more than 100 people were working at the time, was obliterated by the second tornado.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath, the company set up a fund for victims.</p> <p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re heartbroken about this, and our immediate efforts are to assist those affected by this terrible disaster,&#x201D; CEO Troy Propes <a href=\"https://kycir.org/2021/12/13/mayfield-candle-factorys-labor-practices-under-scrutiny-in-wake-of-deadly-tornado/\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement posted to the company&#x2019;s website</a>. &#x201C;Our company is family-owned and our employees, some who have worked with us for many years, are cherished.&#x201D;</p> <h2>Prison labor</h2> <p>Some of the factory&#x2019;s employees, however, came from local jails. Seven of the workers in the factory that night were from the Graves County jail as part of a work program that had started that week, <a href=\"https://kycir.org/2021/12/13/mayfield-candle-factorys-labor-practices-under-scrutiny-in-wake-of-deadly-tornado/\" target=\"_blank\">the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting reported Monday</a>.

The company was fined $16,350.</p> <p>The company&#x2019;s injury rate was also above average for the industry in 2020, with 4.2 injuries per 100 full-time employees, according to Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting.</p> <p>And in 2020, the company <a href=\"https://www.paducahsun.com/news/local/lawsuit-alleges-improper-firing-at-manufacturer/article_c9a40d5c-0a4c-5ef2-adfc-ffc1e1a63b8c.html\" target=\"_blank\">faced a weight discrimination lawsuit in state court</a>, brought by an employee recruited from Puerto Rico who said he was terminated because he was overweight &#x201C;and no other legitimate reason.&#x201D; The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, but a text message screenshot attached the lawsuit and attributed to chief financial officer David Burch read: &#x201C;We are working diligently to clean up the epileptic, obese, pregnant, and special needs issues.&#x201D;</p> <p>At least 74 deaths <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/kentucky-tornado-governor-andy-beshear-news-conference-watch-live-stream-today-2021-12-14/\" target=\"_blank\">have been confirmed in Kentucky so far</a>, according to Gov.

") (encoded nil "<p>Put down the elbow macaroni, hot glue, and &#x201C;one free hug&#x201D; coupon book&#x2014;there&#x2019;s still time for you to pick up a thoughtful, last-minute gift that doesn&#x2019;t involve construction paper or figurative IOUs. We know you procrastinated (even though we totally warned you about supply chain issues), and we forgive you. Your friends, significant others, and family members, however&#x2026; Well, they may not be so full of grace.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p> <p>The best last-minute gifts are the ones that show up on time. Don&#x2019;t bother with murky delivery estimates and fine-printed guarantees from overseas sellers&#x2014;even if you got someone the best gift ever, showing up empty-handed to the gift-swap is 1,000% <i>not </i>the move. Instead, play it safe and get someone a unique last-minute gift that doesn&#x2019;t suck. None coming to mind? That&#x2019;s where we come in. We&#x2019;ve strung together a candy necklace of the best last-minute gifts that won&#x2019;t break the bank (or your loved one&#x2019;s heart) from celebrity Cameos, tie dye classes, and non-corny gift cards to wine subscription boxes and more.</p> <h2>A message from their favorite celeb</h2> <p>You can tell them how much they rock as much as you want, but it&#x2019;ll never be as great as a personalized &#x201C;you rock&#x201D; message from their favorite celebrity. Perhaps they&#x2019;re Wayne Knight stans, or maybe they&#x2019;d love a shoutout from the Tommy Chong or Lindsay Lohan.&#xA0;</p> <h2>A gift they can guzzle</h2> <p>Because Uncle Sam can&#x2019;t get his greedy, puritanical paws out of your hooch, you can&#x2019;t make your own liquor at home in the States. Instead of trying your hand at an illegal home distillation setup, buy your giftee a nice bottle this holiday season. Whiskey is always a hit, but a unique amaro they haven&#x2019;t tried yet is also a great gift.&#xA0;</p> <h2>A present that keeps on giving</h2> <p>You know what&apos;s better than ONE box full of something you really like and didn&apos;t have to pay for yourself? Three, six, or 12 boxes stuffed with wondrous new possessions. Subscription boxes are a great way to pay it forward, literally, and these days there&apos;s something for everyone, from the shameless gourmand to the skincare-obsessed hyaluronic acid addict.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Teach a friend to fish (or tie-dye)&#xA0;</h2> <p>While there is certainly truth to the old adage that ignorance is bliss, education also has <i>some </i>positive gains, we guess. We can certainly say that about learning how to tie-dye your clothes, make killer cocktails, paint your masterpiece, or cook a bomb meal&#x2014;all options if you gift one of <a href=\"https://www.uncommongoods.com/fun/experiences\" target=\"_blank\">Uncommon Goods&apos; &quot;Experiences.&quot;</a> The lucky recipient will be mailed a kit with everything they need ahead of the virtual classes, which take place in January and February. Your friend or fam member can still partake in plenty of cool DIY experiences if you sign them up now, including a <a href=\"https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/romantic-date-night-painting-class\" target=\"_blank\">date night painting class</a>, <a href=\"https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/in-the-cards-how-to-read-tarot-class-deck\" target=\"_blank\">tarot card reading</a>, <a href=\"https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/written-in-the-stars-birth-chart-class\" target=\"_blank\">astrology charting</a>, the aforementioned tie-dye class, and more.</p> <h2>They watch a ton of MUNCHIES videos&#xA0;</h2> <p>We love them. We are them. <a href=\"http://www.fromourplace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Our Place</a> is one of our favorite kitchen gear retailers, from the brand&#x2019;s super-popular Always Pan to aesthetically pleasing drinkware and ceramics. Plus, a gift card is a great move when you&#x2019;re not sure what they&#x2019;re in need of in the kitchen department&#x2014;let them take their pick, because there are lots of crazy-cool color options.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The gift of (plant) parenthood</h2> <p>Plants are a great gift, but it&#x2019;s tough to gauge someone&#x2019;s level of readiness when it comes to owning a photosynthesizing friend. Instead, get them a gift card to <a href=\"https://www.thesill.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sill</a>, one of our favorite plant purveyors. That way, if they&#x2019;re not looking to get into a serious, committed relationship with, say, a <a href=\"https://www.thesill.com/products/large-croton\" target=\"_blank\">large Croton</a>, they can ease into plant parenthood with an <a href=\"https://www.thesill.com/collections/plants-for-beginners\" target=\"_blank\">easy-care variety</a>.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Knowledge is power&#xA0;</h2> <p>It&#x2019;s also a choice last-minute holiday gift. Everyone can stand to learn a little more about pretty much everything, and a <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MasterClass</a> is a great way to help further or kick start a new hobby. Do they like <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg8byk/how-to-make-sausage-at-home\" target=\"_blank\">making their own sausage</a> and smokin&#x2019; meats? Get them Aaron Franklin&#x2019;s guide to barbecue. Is Dad finally ready to take his neighborhood garage band to the next level? <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/epx44e/metallica-masterclass-launch\" target=\"_blank\">Let Metallica show him</a> and his beer-drinking buddies the ropes.&#xA0;</p> <h2>A streaming service that feels a little luxe</h2> <p>You know the type: They&#x2019;re always asking you if you &#x201C;saw the fights last night,&#x201D; and can&#x2019;t believe you didn&#x2019;t wake up at an obscure hour to root for your favorite Premier League team. If your giftee is this person, they&#x2019;ll love a ESPN+ subscription for streaming UFC Fight Nights, baseball, college basketball, soccer, golf, and more.&#xA0;</p> <p><i><b><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnplus/\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN+, $6.99/month</a></b></i></p> <h2>A Huckberry gift card for the aspiring outdoorsperson</h2> <p>There are a lot of reasons why we love <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8xkq/huckberry-annual-sale-best-deals\" target=\"_blank\">Huckberry</a>, with its smart synthesis of modern tech and style with rugged lumbersexual vibes. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpb58/best-huckberry-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\">The site is full of genius gifts</a>, but if you&#x2019;re blanking on what to get or worried about shipping delays, go with a gift card; there&#x2019;s truly something for everyone, from cozy workwear to camping gadgets.</p> <h2>Here to save the day is&#x2026;</h2> <p>&#x2026;Nordstrom! There are still plenty of products from the department store&#x2014;which has an ocean-vast selection of stuff&#x2014;that will arrive before the holidays, and you can also spring for next-day shipping on a slew of items. Perhaps your significant other needs a new pair of gloves, or you really want to blow Grandma away with a sick candle this year. Add to cart, receive, gift. (You can also order online and pick up at your local Nordstrom brick and mortar store.)</p> <h2>Primed and ready to rock this holiday season</h2> <p>If there&#x2019;s one thing that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> is good for, it&#x2019;s shooting gifts from a cannon directly to your doorstep in a matter of days. If you&#x2019;re browsing, just switch the little filter on the side of the page to &#x201C;Prime Only&#x201D; and peruse a seemingly endless string of gifts that will arrive in just a few short days. We&#x2019;ve been eyeing cycling computers, mini Fujifilm cameras, and noise-canceling earbuds by Bose.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p> <h2>Let there be luggage</h2> <p>Look for <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8g97/best-unique-travel-gifts\" target=\"_blank\">travel gifts for the perma-OOO friend</a>? If you&#x2019;ve got a feeling that they&#x2019;re jonesing for some new bags or on-the-go accessories, an <a href=\"http://www.awaytravel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Away</a> gift card is the move. Pick your denomination, and wish them bon voyage on their next getaway that&#x2019;s lowkey making you super jealous.</p> <h2>A getaway for a special someone</h2> <p>Wuh oh; did you super screw up, and this person is <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxd5jn/best-gifts-long-term-boyfriend-girlfriend-partner\" target=\"_blank\">a long-term boo who deserves something nice this year</a>? Last-minute pro tip: Plan a special trip with them, whether that means a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88n88z/best-treehouse-rentals\" target=\"_blank\">romantic weekend in a treehouse</a>, a vibey <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4awyqm/unique-couples-vacation-airbnb-joshua-tree\" target=\"_blank\">voyage to Joshua Tree</a>, or a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg8zgb/best-airbnbs-for-seeing-fall-leaves\" target=\"_blank\">cozy cabin upstate</a>. When the gift exchange comes around, show them a photo of your destination, and wipe the sweat off your bro that you dodged looking like a low-effort jabroni.</p> <p>See you next year, when you hopefully learn your gift-procrastinating lesson.

And frankly? That&apos;s fine. The rest of the year, it&apos;s hard for us to keep up, and frankly, it&apos;s time to upgrade from your ancient Bluetooth speaker, cracked-screen phone, and the earbuds you&apos;ve been holding on to since they were passed out on your flight to Milwaukee in 2018. The new stuff is smarter, sleeker, and more packed with carefully curated features than ever before, in all realms of tech including home devices, sound bars, laptops, and gaming systems.&#xA0;</p> <p>So pass the mashed potatoes and remind your family to hold off on giving you socks for the fourth year in a row: It&#x2019;s 2021, baby.

Use it to guide your own quest for the greatest deals as you rifle through the holiday sales, or print out a few copies and hand them out to the people shopping for you. It&#x2019;s your call.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The Best Smart Home Devices of 2021</h2> <p>While it&#x2019;s a little trippy turning our homes into living, breathing computers, smart home products let us dim the lights, turn on the fire Miguel track, and answer the door without lifting a finger&#x2014;and frankly, that&#x2019;s rad. Here are the hottest home tech products of the holiday season.</p> <h2>Google Nest</h2> <p>Ready to welcome a Netflix-playing robot into your home? The Google Nest Hub will tell you the weather, play music through your sound system, help you turn appliances on and off, and more. It&apos;s kind of like having your very own Alfred Pennyworth. (It&#x2019;s also on sale right now.)&#xA0;</p> <h2>Amazon Echo&#xA0;</h2> <p>You&#x2019;re committed to Alexa, it&#x2019;s cool. The new 4th generation Echo is currently 40% off on its mothership realtor. If you&#x2019;re looking for rich sound for your favorite tunes in addition to a smart home hub, this little orb&#x2019;s got you covered.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Blink Video Doorbell</h2> <p>It&#x2019;s like screening your calls, but for visitors. You can also take the 80 bucks you save on this smart doorbell and spend it on a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31uWBCU\" target=\"_blank\">2019 Echo Show</a> that will connect to your new digital doorman.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The Best Headphones of 2021</h2> <p>Lots of the best speakers, headphones, and other audio electronics are still on sale thanks to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dgey/best-black-friday-deals\" target=\"_blank\">Black Friday</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxnyj/best-cyber-monday-deals\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Monday</a>, so add to cart on these spicy sound-blasting meatballs before they sell out.</p> <h2>AirPods Pro</h2> <p>Been putting off upgrading to AirPods from wired headphones because you&apos;re afraid you&apos;ll lose them? Your iPhone&apos;s OS will now tell you if you&apos;ve left your AirPods behind at another location, meaning that the chances of you losing them at the coffee shop is almost zilch. Plus, they have incredible noise cancellation and transparency modes, and best-in-class sound quality.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Sony&#x2019;s WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones</h2> <p>Silencing the world truly is priceless. But if we must talk numbers, then there&#x2019;s no better value than these noise-canceling headphones from Sony that are currently over 100 dollars off.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Bose&#xA0;QuietComfort Headphones</h2> <p>On sale or full price, these bad boys from Bose are worth every penny. If you buy them during the current seasonal sale, though, that&#x2019;s 5,000 extra pennies saved in your piggy bank.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The Best Speakers and Audio Equipment of 2021</h2> <p>Still using that tiny, tinny Bluetooth speaker you got for free from the holiday raffle in 2016? Pal, no. Get thee some decent bass.</p> <h2>Bose Smart Soundbar&#xA0;</h2> <p>Gifts don&#x2019;t do you any good if they&#x2019;re stuck at the North Pole. Which, judging by the dumpster fire that is the world&apos;s current supply chain, is a real threat this holiday season. This Bose smart sound bar may not be on sale, but it&#x2019;s available for fast delivery, so you can confidently schedule a better-sounding movie marathon on Christmas morning.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Sonos Roam</h2> <p>Move over, crappy travel speaker you&#x2019;ve had since college. It&#x2019;s time for an upgrade. Invest in a Sonos Roam. It adapts its sound to fit your surroundings, plus, it&#x2019;s waterproof. Now that&#x2019;s a grown-up portable speaker.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Kanto U4 Speakers</h2> <p>Alas, when I bought these speakers this summer, my tarot cards did not tell me that in only a few short months they&#x2019;d be 40 dollars off. Learn from my mistakes and strike while the iron&#x2019;s hot. These speakers have a built-in phono preamp, which makes them an ideal set for upgrading your turntable setup without actually having to learn what a preamp is and how to select one.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Sony Bookshelf Speaker System</h2> <p>Normally, you&#x2019;d be hard pressed to find this high-fidelity pair of bookshelf speakers for more than 70 bucks off, but as Taylor Swift says, &#x2018;Tis the damn season.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The Best TVs and Streaming Devices of 2021</h2> <p>With the amount of time we now spend pummeling our brains with <i>Love Island</i> and <i>True Crime</i>, doing it with seamless streaming and high-def screens is honestly quite worth it.</p> <h2>Samsung 4K Smart TVs&#xA0;</h2> <p>If you&#x2019;re a veteran Black Friday shopper, chances are you&#x2019;ve witnessed hand-to-hand combat over a TV out on the front lines. B&amp;H is doing its part to keep us all civilized by launching its deals online, like this 65-inch Samsung Smart TV. At 250 dollars off, it&#x2019;s a deal worth throwing hands over.&#xA0;</p> <h2>TCL&#xA0;QLED Smart TVs</h2> <p>This Roku smart TV normally costs more than my monthly rent. In the spirit of the season, it&#x2019;s now in the three-digit pricing. Go crazy.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Roku Ultra&#xA0;</h2> <p>Even with Black Friday prices, not all of us are in the market for a new TV. That doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re excluded from a streaming glow-up, though. The Roku Ultra&#x2014;which comes with 30 free days of HBO Max&#x2014;is now 34% off on Amazon.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Apple TV&#xA0;</h2> <p>Calling all Apple devotees: The 2021 Apple TV 4K is here, ready to enhance the visuals of your existing setup and open the doors to the world of Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, and HBO Max.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The Best Gamer Gifts of 2021</h2> <p>Yep&#x2014;you know them already. But here&#x2019;s the latest on the greatest from Nintendo, Xbox, and Oculus.</p> <h2>Nintendo Switch&#xA0;</h2> <p>The elusive Nintendo Switch has been sold out for months, since it&#x2019;s naturally at the top of everyone&apos;s holiday shopping list. The supply chain gods have pulled themselves together in preparation for Black Friday, though,&#xA0; and now the coveted console is back in stock at Walmart. Godspeed, friends.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Xbox Series S</h2> <p>Walmart&#x2019;s Black Friday deal on the Xbox Series X is already out of stock, so you don&#x2019;t want to sleep on the Series S. My advice? Shop this one before all the egg nog from holiday parties puts you out of commission.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Oculus Quest 2</h2> <p>Ready to get all <i>Ready Player One</i> in your living room? Time to finally try out this world-bending VR headset.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The Best Laptops and Tablets of 2021</h2> <p>There&#x2019;s nothing quite like getting a new laptop or tablet to make you realize how much better tech is getting year after year. Even an upgrade from a three-year-old model can make a huge difference, which is why it&#x2019;s smart to shop for new computers while prices are low for holiday sales.</p> <h2>MacBook Pro</h2> <p>The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is still an investment. But Best Buy&#x2019;s generous 500-dollar price drop makes the Apple powerhouse a little more attainable.&#xA0;</p> <h2>MacBook Air</h2> <p>2020 was a No Good Year, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean we have to shun the perfectly good MacBooks that were made during that bleak, bleak time. Thanks to B&amp;H, you can snag this high-performing 13.3-inch MacBook Air for under a thousand bucks.&#xA0;</p> <h2>HP Chromebook&#xA0;</h2> <p>Educators and students who were thrown into the abyss of virtual learning have come to rely on the humble Chromebook&#x2014;and for good reason.</p> <h2>Apple iPad Pro</h2> <p>Good luck finding the latest iPad at a discounted price any other time of the year. If you&#x2019;ve been coveting this beauty, now&#x2019;s your time to act. Its M1 chip sets it apart from the generation of iPads before it; now you can play console-level games and enjoy next-level graphics when you use your iPad for all your creative pursuits.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Samsung Galaxy Tab S7</h2> <p>Using your holiday wishlist to fund your new work gadgets may sound lame, and it kinda is, but it&#x2019;s less so when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7. It&#x2019;s designed for work, and gives you the performance of a PC all in tablet form. Right now, it&#x2019;s yours for under $500 on Amazon.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Microsoft Surface Tablets</h2> <p>If you&#x2019;re looking for a budget-friendly tablet that doesn&#x2019;t skimp on storage, display, battery life, or graphics, let me introduce you to the Microsoft Surface Go 2. It&#x2019;s also half the price of an iPad, all the live-long year.&#xA0;</p> <h2>The Best Wearable Tech of 2021</h2> <p>Get those 10,000 steps in for sure. And better yet, don&#x2019;t fumble around for your phone whenever you want to see what time it is.</p> <h2>Apple Watch Series 7</h2> <p>Apple Watch diehards will notice the upgrades on the Series 7: More screen area, more crack-resistant front-crystal, and a quicker charging time. Plus, when you buy an Apple Watch, you get three free months of Fitness+ - just enough time for you to set and discard your New Year&#x2019;s resolution to be a healthier you.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Fitbit Charge 5</h2> <p>Healthnuts, gather &#x2018;round to track your pace and heart rate come January, when you&apos;re trying to work off all the candy cane Joe-Joes. The new Fitbit Charge 5 comes with stress management tools, which you hopefully won&#x2019;t have to utilize as much in 2022.&#xA0;(It&#x2019;s also marked down right now.)</p> <p>Enjoy the upgrades, and may your smart devices be obedient and all your content be fire in 2022.</p>") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Brace yourselves.") (encoded nil "<p>Back in the day, car companies made money by selling cars and financing those car purchases. Now, automakers plan to make even more money by selling subscriptions and software updates to cars that have already been sold, perhaps even for features people expect cars to have. Brace yourselves now for this nickel-and-diming future.</p> <p>Automakers have been fairly explicit that they see &#x201C;Software as a Service,&#x201D; as it is known in business speak, as a significant earner to make back some of the billions of dollars they invest in electric and autonomous vehicle development. Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler, said last week during its &#x201C;Software Day&#x201D; presentation <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/stellantis-plans-to-generate-22point5-billion-in-new-software-revenue-by-2030.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>it expects to generate $22.5 billion from software and subscription sales alone</span></a>. Volkswagen, <a href=\"https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/oct/1006-investor.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>General Motors</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2021/05/13/power-up-ford-sees-potential-new-revenue-better-experience/5057572001/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Ford</span></a> have made similar projections.&#xA0;</p> <p>The automakers frame this as an exciting new revenue stream to get investors excited while giving customers greater choice about what features they pay for. But it is a lot of dressed up marketing verbiage that means they&#x2019;re going to charge you more than once for the same product.</p> <p>This approach is not entirely new to the car world. Many automakers have been charging extra to use app-based functions through phones for years, features that most people can and do ignore. But, recently, automakers have been testing the waters on expanding these subscription-based features. For example, Toyota is now <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/news/43329/toyota-made-its-key-fob-remote-start-into-a-subscription-service\" target=\"_blank\"><span>charging $80 a year</span></a> for people who bought their cars years ago to keep using the remote start function on their key fobs, claiming the first several years were merely a &#x201C;free trial period.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>But the big play here is not going to be the $80-a-year stuff for marginal features like remote start. Instead, it will be performance, range, and perhaps even safety upgrades to electric vehicles that make the actual car better at being a car. These were upgrades that were difficult or impossible to engineer with gas cars, but are relatively trivial for electric ones. The goal, from the automakers&#x2019; perspective, will be getting people to pay for the same thing multiple times as often as possible.&#xA0;</p> <p>This strategy is taking its cue from Tesla, which <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/support/upgrades\" target=\"_blank\"><span>calls over-the-air upgrades</span></a> &#x201C;an essential part of the Tesla ownership experience.&#x201D; Tesla has offered all kinds of over-the-air upgrades, both free software updates and paid ones. For example, Tesla charges thousands of dollars extra for its Autopilot and FSD Beta driver assist systems. This makes some sense, as developing these systems costs a lot of extra money that is a separate line of business from making electric cars. For people who don&#x2019;t want Autopilot, they don&#x2019;t have to pay for it.</p> <p>But there is another type of over-the-air upgrade that makes a lot less sense for the consumer. These are upgrades that make the car better at being a car. For example, a long range Model 3 with dual motors is capable of accelerating from 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds. But when you buy the car, it has a 0-60 time of 4.4 seconds. Owners <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2019/12/19/tesla-acceleration-boost-model-3-dual-motor/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>must pay another $2,000</span></a> to unlock that extra half a second. (Some enterprising folks hacked their way around that paywall, but then <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2020/08/22/tesla-fights-back-against-owners-hacking-unlock-performance-boost/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Tesla blocked and reversed the hack</span></a>.) And for years Tesla sold Model S and X vehicles with the same 75 kWh battery but software-locked them to 60 and 70 kWh <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11599718/tesla-model-s-software-battery-upgrade-car-buying-model-change\" target=\"_blank\"><span>unless the owners paid an additional $3,000</span></a> for the extra 30 or 40 miles of range. In at least one instance, Tesla <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/10/16283330/tesla-hurricane-irma-update-florida-extend-range-model-s-x-60-60d\" target=\"_blank\"><span>temporarily unlocked that range</span></a> during evacuation emergencies like hurricanes.&#xA0;</p> <p>Another way of putting this is Tesla builds cars to meet certain specifications but paywalls the top end of that performance. This is fundamentally different from developing a separate line of business around a software package, because the cost of delivering this performance is in the physical characteristics of the car, something the customer has already purchased. It is a subtle but important difference, akin to buying a house with the extra bathroom and bedroom padlocked until you pony up.</p> <p>Naturally, other car companies like the idea of making customers pay twice for things. Polestar, an electric vehicle company spun off from Volvo, <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/news/43418/polestar-2-gains-67-hp-from-ota-update-and-this-is-how-its-going-to-be\" target=\"_blank\"><span>is going to charge an extra $1,000 or so</span></a> for a slight increase in horsepower and torque just like Tesla does.&#xA0;</p> <p>For the paywalled EV performance features sold via software update, car companies are simply double-dipping. If you buy a car with a 75 kWh battery pack, you&#x2019;re paying for a 75 kWh battery pack. And then, should an owner choose to unlock that extra range, they pay for it again.</p> <p>Perhaps the most worrying aspect of this future is the implications for what it means to actually own a car. It is strange to think about having a car with 15 kWh of battery underneath your feet that you simply cannot use because it&#x2019;s behind a paywall. If that&#x2019;s the case, then what features of the car does someone truly own? What aspects of a car can never go behind a paywall? These are questions that we&#x2014;or, more likely, federal regulators&#x2014;will probably have to ask sooner rather than later.</p>") (guid ((isPermaLink . "false")) "epxzya") (enclosure ((url .

Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength,&#x201D; Rowling tweeted. &#x201C;The Penised Individual Who Raped You Is a Woman.&#x201D;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1470092815506063365\"></iframe> <p>The comment is only the latest in a string of efforts by the once-beloved author to amplify a narrative that&#x2019;s not only essentially false but also ignores the devastatingly high level of violence experienced by trans people.&#xA0;</p> <p>In June 2020, Rowling published a 3,700-word essay about what her fears around what she called the &#x201C;new trans activism,&#x201D; accusing trans people of &#x201C;pushing to erode the legal definition of sex and replace it with gender.&#x201D; That essay quickly sparked accusations that Rowling was a TERF, or trans-exclusive radical feminist, as Rowling drew on her own experience as a sexual assault survivor to suggest that trans women are a threat to cisgender women.</p> <p>In the year-plus since, Rowling has sporadically implied that trans people and those who advocate for their rights are dangerous.</p> <p>But Rowling&#x2019;s narrative&#x2014;that trans people are somehow perpetuating an Orwellian takeover&#x2014;is misleading on multiple fronts. It obscures the fact that it&#x2019;s cis men, not trans women, who regular commit sexual assault. Only a fraction of a percent of U.S. adults identify as transgender&#x2014;yet almost one in five women have experienced completed or attempted rape, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/sexual-violence/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>according to the Centers for Disease Control</span></a>. (One in 38 men have experienced the same.) For anyone trying to pin the epidemic of assault on trans people, the numbers just don&#x2019;t add up.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;People will say from one side of their mouth that trans women are an incredibly small part of the population and that the world shouldn&apos;t bend to their desires, but will then say that we are so influential and powerful that we must be stopped; specifically to save women from rape,&#x201D; YouTuber Kat Blaque tweeted after Rowling&#x2019;s comments.</p> <p>Blaque added, &#x201C;Are the only people capable of rape and sexual assault men? Would you define rape solely by penetration?

The two had been feuding over a waterpark project and taking shots at each other in the local press and social media for months, and decided the best way to settle their beef was a good old-fashioned fight.</p> <p>In September, Silva challenged the mayor to a fistfight, calling him a &#x201C;crook&#x201D; and blaming him for allegedly failing to conserve a waterpark on a river that passes Borba, where Peixoto is mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/brazilian-politicians-in-three-round-punch-up-after-waterpark-feud\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>Peixoto eventually agreed to the fight but only if it was organized properly inside a ring, saying he was the mayor, and &#x201C;not a street fighter.&#x201D;</p> <div class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\" data-children-count=\"0\"><iframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/n7bx7b/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>The fight finally happened in the early hours of Sunday morning in the gymnasium of a local school, and was live-streamed on the mayor&apos;s Facebook account.</p> <p>Surrounded by onlookers, the two politicians entered the ring around 2:30 am. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/prefeitosimaopeixoto/videos/1520699881638402\" target=\"_blank\">Video of the fight</a> shows the mayor debuting to a Brazilian pop ballad called &#x201C;Um Novo Vencedor&#x201D;&#x2014;A New Winner. Peixoto then approached Silva, and ran his finger across his neck, in a gesture signifying the decapitation of his rival.</p> <p>The three-round battle started with Silva aggressively going at the mayor with leg kicks, until Peixoto connected with a right jab knocking his opponent to the ground. The mayor then pounced on him, pinning him to the ground while landing a few more punches. But the momentum changed quickly after that, with Silva flipping the mayor and landing several blows of his own.</p> <p>The men then proceeded to land several punches and kicks on each other until the first round ended. The two politicians&#x2019; lack of professional training was obvious, as both men appeared tired and worn out quickly. Through the remainder of the two rounds, their kicks and punches were sloppy and rigid, but seemingly effective as the fight slowed down as it continued.</p> <p>Although Silva seemed to have the upper hand in the final two rounds, landing numerous kicks on the mayor before the bout ended, when the judges gave their final call, Mayor Peixoto was declared the winner.</p> <p>Local media were surprised by the result.</p> <p>&#x201C;The mayor took such a beating, his jaw dropped,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.fatoamazonico.com.br/no-tatame-em-borba-prefeito-simao-peixoto-apanha-de-ex-vereador-mirico-mas-ganha-luta-de-mma/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote Fato Amaz&#xF4;nico</a>.

Peixoto and Silva hugged and shook hands, patting each other on the back, after the judge&apos;s declared the mayor the winner.</p> <p>While the two politicians may finally have a decision on who could win in a fight, it&apos;s unclear how the battle will affect the waterpark that instigated the brawl in the first place.</p>") (guid ((isPermaLink .

(encoded nil "<p>&#x201C;Getting socks&#x201D; for the holidays, we know, is a trope&#x2014;and not a particularly good one. But today, we&#x2019;re gonna change your mind. Socks are actually <i>not</i> a bad present at all. In fact, they&#x2019;re a great gift, and as the world <strike>doom-spiral freefalls</strike> shifts into the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxdd74/zuckerbergs-metaverse-is-screwed-if-it-doesnt-allow-sex\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>, filling your loved ones&apos; stockings with socks is actually a very topical gift. What&#x2019;s more meta than a sock within a sock, amirite?&#xA0;</p> <p>But socks are so much more than, well, socks. Socks are the gift of warmth, the gift of personality. Think of a sk8r boi, his shins adorned with HUF&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/style/2016/04/huf-plantlife-socks\" target=\"_blank\">iconic</a> <a href=\"https://www.pacsun.com/huf/green-helpers-crew-socks-2528990.html\" target=\"_blank\">weed leaf socks</a>, or even just the average banker bro, suited up to do some stonking down on the ol&#x2019; trade market. What is Chet wearing? A blue three-piece, yes, but under those pleated pants? Funny socks&#x2014;probably ones with hot dogs on &#x2018;em, because Chet is a little silly goose. A real stinker, that Chet. So it is.&#xA0;</p> <p>Socks are one of the first things you put on in the morning, and one of the last things you take off. They&#x2019;re a present that says, &#x201C;I care about your feet,&#x201D; and also, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not Bill Gates.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve compiled a laundry list of some of the best socks to give as holiday presents, from those designed for utility and comfort to ones that let you wear your personality on your ankles. Sock on, dudes.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Sometimes, less is more&#xA0;</h2> <p>There are days when our pinkies hold teacups, and our foot tubes require frills and pearls. But there are also the days when our feet crave nothing more, and nothing less, than the logo of a Very Good, Very True workwear-inspired brand like Dickies, Carhartt, or <i>[air horn] </i>Gold Toe.</p> <h2>Like walking on a cloud</h2> <p>Rec Room Contributor Adam Rothbarth loves these bad boys, and as he recently <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvggj/vice-editors-picks-holiday-gift-ideas\" target=\"_blank\">wrote for VICE</a>, &#x201C;Bombas socks are soft and incredibly cozy, and they also just look real, real good. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc\" target=\"_blank\">refuse to answer the call</a> of socks this holiday season, but I&#x2019;m picking up every time.&#x201D;</p> <h2>For the chiller in your life</h2> <p>They like to take things easy&#x2014;and we respect them for that. We envy their &#x201C;no problemo&#x201D; attitude, and these <strike>aesthetic</strike> socks are the perfect way to show them you&#x2019;re proud to be their type-A friend.&#xA0;</p> <h2>America runs on Truckin&#x2019;</h2> <p>Yes, <a href=\"https://fadalbert.bigcartel.com/product/truckin-slap\" target=\"_blank\">yes it does</a>. Your giftee will love strutting their tie-dye calves around the house&#x2014;or at very serious formal events. Hey, at least they didn&#x2019;t wear flip-flops to a funeral again, right?&#xA0;</p> <h2>Stirred, not shaken</h2> <p>If you&#x2019;ve been paying attention, you know that ordering a James Bond-style martini results in a watered-down drink. These cocktail socks (sock-tails?) are a great gift for the martini-lover in your life&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll be able to make jokes about their socks being &#x201C;dirty&#x201D; until they get cut off.</p> <h2>It&#x2019;s called art, Google it</h2> <p>Don&#x2019;t be so uncultured, Michael. Everyone knows the only thing cooler than owning one-eighth of seven different NFTs are these six pairs of socks made to look like famous paintings of yore. <i>[Right clicks.]</i></p> <h2>Your feet deserve the best&#xA0;</h2> <p>Here&#x2019;s the scene: These socks, one trenchcoat, no clothes, and buckets of glittering Paramount Studios rain while you ratatattaaa with that cane. We love this movie, even if Gene Kelly is rolling in his grave.</p> <h2>They&#x2019;re Chris Traeger</h2> <p>Some folks just love working out. It&#x2019;s a thing. (Personally, I work out because I&#x2019;m terrified of heart disease and I love lording how many miles I ran or hours I spent on the stationary bike over my buddies, but I&#x2019;d be a dirty rotten liar if I didn&#x2019;t say that I absolutely hated it.) For the peeps out there that can&#x2019;t get enough of the #FitLife, get them some dope athletic socks. For the lifter, go with the retro-cool Nikes so they look sick when they post selfies with captions about Jesus. For the runner, pick up these Balegas with blister-resistant tech&#x2014;nobody likes a bloody shoe.</p> <h2>The fire emoji is your response to everything</h2> <p>We get it: It&#x2019;s been a long two years and you&#x2019;ve forgotten how to interact with humans in a regular, offline way. Instead of carrying around a stack of printed-out emojis, just point to your socks instead. Think of it like analog texting.&#xA0;</p> <h2>You worship at the temple of Venus</h2> <p>Ass out, socks up, that&#x2019;s the way I like to pay my respects to the ancient lady deities. Also, the drawings on these socks by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/martin_groch/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Groch</a> are just sick.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Socks with benefits&#xA0;</h2> <p>These socks are your buddy. Your friend. Your comrad(e). In case you aren&apos;t familiar with compression socks, they&#x2019;re great for helping to reduce swelling and decrease risk of blood clots, which is why they&apos;re popular for wearing on planes. They&#x2019;re also moisture-wicking, and help with all-day energy, support, and comfort.</p> <h2>Their brand is &#x201C;grandparent&#x201D;</h2> <p>They wear old sweaters, round glasses, and are really into composting. You get the picture. The only thing missing from their vintage ensemble? These old-school Wool Camp Socks by Flint and Tinder.</p> <h2>Don&apos;t worry, we remembered</h2> <p>If you&#x2019;re reading this, there&#x2019;s a non-zero chance that you already own a pair of these bad boys, but perhaps your giftee is still in need of some classic AF pot socks by HUF. All the kids at the&#xA0;Parents Let Them Smoke Weed Table&#xA0;Cool Table wore these back in high school, and they&#x2019;re still an iconic, relaxed look.</p> <h2>The final boss</h2> <p>Oh, you thought you had style? That you were cool? Bummer. Welcome to the show, dude. These socks will literally be the coolest thing you own, second only to wearing actual <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gvwy/socks-with-sandals\" target=\"_blank\">socks with sandals</a>.&#xA0;</p> <p>Really gift &#x2018;em hard this year, people.

Matto, apparently, was doing this the hard way, curating each gas-inducing meal to produce a custom bouquet for every customer and turning her body into a high-volume fart factory.&#xA0; That&#x2019;s good customer service for sure, but it&#x2019;s also a quick way to misery; as demand for the jars increased, she said on YouTube, it started getting harder to get those farts out the door, which is how she ended up in the hospital with chest pains.</p> <div class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\" data-children-count=\"0\"><iframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/88aybx/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>&#x201C;I could tell that something was not right that evening when I was lying in bed and I could feel a pressure in my stomach moving upward.

Nothing was wrong with her heart, doctors told her, but the high-bean and protein shake diet was to blame; they advised that she take a gas suppressant medication and lay off the boiled eggs, which she said &#x201C;effectively ended my business.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Now, her fart jars are available in JPEG form tied to a blockchain receipt, for 0.05 ETH, or about $200, each. &#x201C;Imagine the smell!&#x201D; the website says. &#x201C;These NFTs are just as beautiful, unique, and rare as my actual poots! You can practically smell how delightful they are through the screen. Just use your imagination!&#x201D; The first run includes 5,000 NFTs, which means Matto could net $1 million if they all sell out.&#xA0;</p> <p>She hasn&#x2019;t completely abandoned the gassy life, either: 100 tokens will be redeemable for a real fart jar, according to the site. 70 NFTs will get you panties worn by Matto, 30 will get you used lingerie, and 10 NFTs are redeemable for jars that she has queefed in. NFT holders can also access perks like a private Discord channel or meeting Matto over Zoom.&#xA0;</p> <p>The project has a public Discord that has already gained 3,000 members. Refreshingly, it doesn&#x2019;t promise a future video game or &#x201C;metaverse&#x201D; like many NFT projects. &#x201C;The FART JAR project has no roadmap,&#x201D; the website states. &#x201C;The tokens have clear and obvious utility, if you have a rare &apos;redeemable trait&apos; the token can be burned for real life collectibles and the utility for the token will be access to a private discord channel with reality TV star and internet sensation Stephanie Matto.&#x201D;</p> <p>She&#x2019;s not the first to lay a fart on the blockchain: In March, Brooklyn-based film director Alex Ram&#xED;rez-Mallis and four of his friends listed a year worth of their recorded farts <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10378154/nft-non-fungible-tokens-fart-recording-sale-alex-ramirez-mallis\" target=\"_blank\"><span>as NFTs</span></a>.

Matto, apparently, was doing this the hard way, curating each gas-inducing meal to produce a custom bouquet for every customer and turning her body into a high-volume fart factory.&#xA0; That&#x2019;s good customer service for sure, but it&#x2019;s also a quick way to misery; as demand for the jars increased, she said on YouTube, it started getting harder to get those farts out the door, which is how she ended up in the hospital with chest pains.</p> <div class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\" data-children-count=\"0\"><iframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/88aybx/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>&#x201C;I could tell that something was not right that evening when I was lying in bed and I could feel a pressure in my stomach moving upward.

Nothing was wrong with her heart, doctors told her, but the high-bean and protein shake diet was to blame; they advised that she take a gas suppressant medication and lay off the boiled eggs, which she said &#x201C;effectively ended my business.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Now, her fart jars are available in JPEG form tied to a blockchain receipt, for 0.05 ETH, or about $200, each. &#x201C;Imagine the smell!&#x201D; the website says. &#x201C;These NFTs are just as beautiful, unique, and rare as my actual poots! You can practically smell how delightful they are through the screen.

NFT holders can also access perks like a private Discord channel or meeting Matto over Zoom.&#xA0;</p> <p>The project has a public Discord that has already gained 3,000 members. Refreshingly, it doesn&#x2019;t promise a future video game or &#x201C;metaverse&#x201D; like many NFT projects. &#x201C;The FART JAR project has no roadmap,&#x201D; the website states. &#x201C;The tokens have clear and obvious utility, if you have a rare &apos;redeemable trait&apos; the token can be burned for real life collectibles and the utility for the token will be access to a private discord channel with reality TV star and internet sensation Stephanie Matto.&#x201D;</p> <p>She&#x2019;s not the first to lay a fart on the blockchain: In March, Brooklyn-based film director Alex Ram&#xED;rez-Mallis and four of his friends listed a year worth of their recorded farts <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10378154/nft-non-fungible-tokens-fart-recording-sale-alex-ramirez-mallis\" target=\"_blank\"><span>as NFTs</span></a>.

Should we start swabbing throats instead?</p> <p>No, you should not, according to the Food and Drug Administration, as well as several public health experts who spoke with VICE News and said the best way to test is to follow the directions.&#xA0;</p> <p>The suggestion that we add throat swabs to self-administered tests has gained steam on social media in recent weeks, particularly after the FDA issued a warning that some antigen rapid tests <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/28/fda-antigen-tests-reduced-sensitivity-omicron-526217\" target=\"_blank\">may not be sensitive enough to detect the Omicron variant</a>.&#xA0;</p> <p>Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a Harvard nutritionist and epidemiologist whose relentless Twitter commentary on COVID-19 <a href=\"https://undark.org/2020/11/25/complicated-rise-of-eric-feigl-ding/\" target=\"_blank\">has divided public health experts</a>, retweeted a follower Saturday who said her husband tested negative via a nasal swab.

The United Kingdom <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qHTBlxfNes\" target=\"_blank\">published guidance in May 2020</a> instructing people self-testing to collect both nasal and throat swabs, and hospitals and health agencies in countries like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1474961627606753285?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WRHospital/status/1476224357622063111?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Canada</a> have also encouraged throat swabbing.&#xA0;</p> <p>Others have touted swabbing your throat in order to get a positive result, including former Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina and others who&#x2019;ve tried it.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1475468989933490179\"></iframe> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/JennyRohn/status/1475410068019585027\"></iframe> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/thacarter91/status/1477403590788591623\"></iframe> <p>But on Tuesday, the FDA issued guidance on at-home tests saying you should not actually do this, citing safety and efficacy concerns. &#x201C;The FDA advises that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing,&#x201D; the FDA <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/04/fda-cautions-against-throat-swab-for-at-home-covid-tests/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow\" target=\"_blank\">told the New York Post Tuesday</a>, adding that it had &#x201C;safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs.&#x201D; (The FDA did not immediately respond to VICE News&#x2019; request for comment.)</p> <p>Dr. Rachel Graham, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina&#x2019;s Gillings School of Public Health, echoed those concerns in an email to VICE News Tuesday.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;A throat swab is going to be more sensitive than a shallow swipe in a dry nose, but it&#x2019;s difficult to self-administer correctly,&#x201D; Graham said. &#x201C;Aside from the high likelihood of triggering a gag reflex if you haven&#x2019;t done one before, you can also hit the tonsils or uvula and potentially skew the results.&#x201D;</p> <p>While Graham said that clinical COVID-19 tests &#x201C;could be more sensitive with the oropharyngeal swab,&#x201D; she noted that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s harder to administer in bulk like it needs to be at testing stations or in the Walgreens drive-thru.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;People should not do anything different than what was clearly validated and shown to work,&#x201D; said Thomas Denny, the chief operating officer at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University.</p> <p>&#x201C;My view on testing is pretty straightforward. And that is that whenever you want to do a test, you need to go through a validation process,&#x201D; meaning running evaluations and studies to make sure throat swabbing actually does help.&#xA0;</p> <p>Dr. Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University&#x2019;s Mailman School of Public Health, told VICE News that some studies show a &#x201C;pool sample&#x201D;&#x2014;meaning samples from different parts of the body&#x2014;appears to be better than a nasal sample alone. Mathema said he doesn&#x2019;t &#x201C;see any harm&#x201D; in testing both nasally and via the throat, but with an important caveat.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;They should be looking at whether the packaging says that [swabbing] the throat is also OK. And I think that&apos;s an important thing,&#x201D; Mathema said.&#xA0;</p> <p>Denny conceded that while there may ultimately be some utility in throat swabbing, the scientific evidence for it isn&#x2019;t there yet.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;There could be some valid data there that says an alternative sample is beneficial, but one would need to validate that,&#x201D; Denny told VICE News&#x2014;meaning running evaluations and studies to make sure throat swabbing actually does boost testing accuracy.</p> <p>&#x201C;I would not start advising people to switch samples just because they may think it&apos;s easier or because social media says it&apos;s better.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;I think there&apos;s a lot of information out there,&#x201D; Denny said. &#x201C;Everybody&apos;s looking for a simple way out of this.

Should we start swabbing throats instead?</p> <p>No, you should not, according to the Food and Drug Administration, as well as several public health experts who spoke with VICE News and said the best way to test is to follow the directions.&#xA0;</p> <p>The suggestion that we add throat swabs to self-administered tests has gained steam on social media in recent weeks, particularly after the FDA issued a warning that some antigen rapid tests <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/28/fda-antigen-tests-reduced-sensitivity-omicron-526217\" target=\"_blank\">may not be sensitive enough to detect the Omicron variant</a>.&#xA0;</p> <p>Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a Harvard nutritionist and epidemiologist whose relentless Twitter commentary on COVID-19 <a href=\"https://undark.org/2020/11/25/complicated-rise-of-eric-feigl-ding/\" target=\"_blank\">has divided public health experts</a>, retweeted a follower Saturday who said her husband tested negative via a nasal swab. Then, after following Ding&#x2019;s suggestion to add a throat swab, the woman&#x2019;s husband apparently tested positive.</p> <p>&#x201C;Omicron is very different from all other variants. We need to adapt to changing testing strategies,&#x201D; Ding tweeted, adding: &#x201C;This story made my day!&#x201D;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1477498074838839296\"></iframe> <p>There is preliminary research indicating that nasal swabs might not always be sufficient to detect Omicron. A <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.22.21268246v1?s=09\" target=\"_blank\">preprinted study</a> from last month looking at 382 patients at a hospital in South Africa found that mid-turbinate tests&#x2014;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55cA9ZOdVFI%5C\" target=\"_blank\">the technical term for those extremely uncomfortable nasal tests</a>&#x2014;detected Omicron 86% of the time, compared with saliva tests, which detected it 100% of the time.&#xA0;</p> <p>Other countries instructed people self-testing to swab their throats well before Omicron appeared. The United Kingdom <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qHTBlxfNes\" target=\"_blank\">published guidance in May 2020</a> instructing people self-testing to collect both nasal and throat swabs, and hospitals and health agencies in countries like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1474961627606753285?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WRHospital/status/1476224357622063111?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Canada</a> have also encouraged throat swabbing.&#xA0;</p> <p>Others have touted swabbing your throat in order to get a positive result, including former Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina and others who&#x2019;ve tried it.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1475468989933490179\"></iframe> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/JennyRohn/status/1475410068019585027\"></iframe> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/thacarter91/status/1477403590788591623\"></iframe> <p>But on Tuesday, the FDA issued guidance on at-home tests saying you should not actually do this, citing safety and efficacy concerns. &#x201C;The FDA advises that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing,&#x201D; the FDA <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/04/fda-cautions-against-throat-swab-for-at-home-covid-tests/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow\" target=\"_blank\">told the New York Post Tuesday</a>, adding that it had &#x201C;safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs.&#x201D; (The FDA did not immediately respond to VICE News&#x2019; request for comment.)</p> <p>Dr. Rachel Graham, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina&#x2019;s Gillings School of Public Health, echoed those concerns in an email to VICE News Tuesday.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;A throat swab is going to be more sensitive than a shallow swipe in a dry nose, but it&#x2019;s difficult to self-administer correctly,&#x201D; Graham said. &#x201C;Aside from the high likelihood of triggering a gag reflex if you haven&#x2019;t done one before, you can also hit the tonsils or uvula and potentially skew the results.&#x201D;</p> <p>While Graham said that clinical COVID-19 tests &#x201C;could be more sensitive with the oropharyngeal swab,&#x201D; she noted that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s harder to administer in bulk like it needs to be at testing stations or in the Walgreens drive-thru.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;People should not do anything different than what was clearly validated and shown to work,&#x201D; said Thomas Denny, the chief operating officer at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University.</p> <p>&#x201C;My view on testing is pretty straightforward. And that is that whenever you want to do a test, you need to go through a validation process,&#x201D; meaning running evaluations and studies to make sure throat swabbing actually does help.&#xA0;</p> <p>Dr. Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University&#x2019;s Mailman School of Public Health, told VICE News that some studies show a &#x201C;pool sample&#x201D;&#x2014;meaning samples from different parts of the body&#x2014;appears to be better than a nasal sample alone. Mathema said he doesn&#x2019;t &#x201C;see any harm&#x201D; in testing both nasally and via the throat, but with an important caveat.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;They should be looking at whether the packaging says that [swabbing] the throat is also OK. And I think that&apos;s an important thing,&#x201D; Mathema said.&#xA0;</p> <p>Denny conceded that while there may ultimately be some utility in throat swabbing, the scientific evidence for it isn&#x2019;t there yet.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;There could be some valid data there that says an alternative sample is beneficial, but one would need to validate that,&#x201D; Denny told VICE News&#x2014;meaning running evaluations and studies to make sure throat swabbing actually does boost testing accuracy.</p> <p>&#x201C;I would not start advising people to switch samples just because they may think it&apos;s easier or because social media says it&apos;s better.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;I think there&apos;s a lot of information out there,&#x201D; Denny said. &#x201C;Everybody&apos;s looking for a simple way out of this.

But I do believe Scottish Rite Freemasons are behind the pandemic (overwhelmingly Jewish),&quot; he told Winslow. &quot;And I fear billions of people around the globe right now are being exterminated.&quot;</p> <p>Bateman tried to explain himself by telling Winslow he only sent the email to a few &#x201C;close friends&#x201D; (Winslow&#x2019;s words). The email was sent to people including Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, and Clint Betts, who runs a local industry group dedicated to promoting Utah&apos;s tech industry.</p> <p>Those on the email are now distancing themselves from Bateman and condemning Utah&#x2019;s most famous antisemite.

We Tracked Their Activity." "<p>Buhl, Idaho, is a city of just 4,000 people, best known for the abundance of rainbow trout in its hatcheries and as the birthplace of a famous cigar-smoking televangelist.&#xA0;</p> <p>Yet despite its small size, the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist street-fighting gang, thought that this &#x201C;sleepy red town,&#x201D; and in particular, its annual Fourth of July Sagebrush Days Parade would be a good opportunity to promote their brand.&#xA0;</p> <p>The theme of the 2021 parade was &#x201C;Celebrate the Good Old Days.&#x201D; Kids stayed cool with sno-cones on the side of the road, trucks advertising local businesses rolled by, and the current title holder of Miss Magic Valley Stampede waved to onlookers from atop her heavily accessorized horse.&#xA0;</p> <p>Then came the Proud Boys parade float, decked out with yellow and black balloons and flanked by uniformed members with their faces completely covered by gaiters emblazoned with their logo.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;I heard one mom tell her kiddos it was just a &#x2018;drunk uncle drinking club,&#x2019;&#x201D; remarked one reader in response to an article in the local <i><a href=\"https://magicvalley.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/far-right-group-participates-in-buhl-sagebrush-days-parade/article_45c46c10-a41b-5056-b74e-0436ff88d032.html\" target=\"_blank\">Times-News</a></i> about the Proud Boys&#x2019; involvement.&#xA0;</p> <p>But to others in attendance, just six months after the Jan. 6 insurrection and the arrests of many of their members who stormed the Capitol that day, the Proud Boys were patriots who had every right to participate in Buhl&#x2019;s annual event.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;I did not see these guys doing anything but supporting our country with flags and marching in a parade,&#x201D; commented another reader of the <i>Times-News</i>. &#x201C;I don&apos;t belong to the group, but I have read what they are about and it seems like they support our country and liberty.&#x201D;</p> <h2>Proud Boys Go Local</h2> <p>After the deadly Capitol riot, the Proud Boys appeared to retreat from the national stage amid intense scrutiny, a flurry of serious federal charges (nearly 50 members have been charged so far), and rumored infighting. Then came the bombshell report that their &#x201C;chairman,&#x201D; Enrique Tarrio, was at one time a &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3v8m4/proud-boys-reel-at-report-leader-was-a-rat\" target=\"_blank\">prolific&#x201D; police informan</a>t. All this prompted speculation from some media outlets that the group was on the brink of collapse.&#xA0;</p> <p>But around the spring of 2021, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkb377/all-the-terrible-things-proud-boys-have-done-since-storming-the-capitol\" target=\"_blank\">VICE News noticed a trend</a> that hinted at a different and potentially quite troubling story about the Proud Boys&#x2019; reach, resilience, and ground-level support. It seemed that they were flying under the national radar, and eschewing large-scale, high-profile appearances in favor of quietly solidifying alliances around hot-button political issues and community activism.&#xA0;</p> <p>We spent the last year closely tracking and documenting this trend, and found that Proud Boys made at least 114 uniformed appearances across 73 cities in 24 states between Jan. 6 and Dec. 21, 2021.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;Over the past year, the Proud Boys have worked to embed themselves amongst local activists who haven&#x2019;t been tarnished by the Jan. 6 insurrection,&#x201D; said Devin Burghart, executive director of the Missouri-based Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights (IREHR)<b>. </b>&#x201C;They&#x2019;ve enmeshed themselves into local efforts to push back against vaccine mandates, or critical race theory, and other local conflicts, which has allowed them to steer clear of the national discussion about the insurrection and provide them with a base of support that they didn&#x2019;t have prior to Jan. 6.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <div class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\" data-children-count=\"0\"><iframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/z3n3m8/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>For example, they organized an Easter egg hunt in a Chicago suburb, serenaded a crowd of anti-vaxxers outside California&#x2019;s Capitol in Sacramento with a nationalist ballad, and posed a menacing presence at school board meetings where &#x201C;critical race theory&#x201D; was being discussed. They&#x2019;ve put together Christmas toy drives for terminally ill children in places like Seattle, Long Island, and Miami. They&#x2019;ve provided security for the &#x201C;Church at Planned Parenthood,&#x201D; led by an evangelical anti-abortion pastor, in Salem, Oregon.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;We have the Proud Boys across the street,&#x201D; said Pastor Ken Peters in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RWParlerWatch/status/1415189647127285760?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">a livestream</a> from the Salem event in July, turning the camera to a group of men in the group&#x2019;s uniform. &#x201C;Oh my goodness, thank God for the Proud Boys.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re out to make the case for the Proud Boys, show that they&#x2019;re not bad people, that they&#x2019;re here to help the community,&#x201D; said Daryle Lamont Jenkins, an antifascist researcher who has tracked the far-right for decades and runs <a href=\"https://onepeoplesproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">One People&#x2019;s Project,</a> which monitors hate groups. <b>&#x201C;</b>They&#x2019;re on some sort of publicity tour. It&apos;s pretty much them trying to sell themselves to the American people.&#x201D;</p> <p>Their PR drive might be paying off. VICE News found scant evidence that Proud Boys encountered any pushback from fellow right-wingers when they showed up to their 2021 events in uniform. Burghart sees the lack of pushback as consistent with a recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute that&#xA0; found that<a href=\"https://www.prri.org/research/competing-visions-of-america-an-evolving-identity-or-a-culture-under-attack/\" target=\"_blank\"> 68% of Republicans</a> believe the baseless conspiracy theory that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;In many camps, the Proud Boys are viewed as the militant wing defending that position,&#x201D; said Burghart. &#x201C;That they, along with the Oath Keepers and other groups, were willing to step forward and fight.&#x201D; The same survey found that 30% of Republicans (and one in five Americans) agreed that &#x201C;true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/jnewsgabe/status/1332810014835105792\"></iframe> <h2>Strategy</h2> <p>VICE News&#x2019; dataset offers key insight into ground-level Proud Boy activity in 2021&#x2014;and a better understanding of their goals headed into a crucial midterm-election year. Burghart says the Proud Boys are a bellwether for the direction and focus of the far-right more broadly.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;The important thing to remember about the Proud Boys is that they&#x2019;ve always been remarkably opportunistic,&#x201D; said Burghart. &#x201C;If you want to know where the momentum is on the far-right, watch where the Proud Boys are going.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>The Proud Boys&#x2019; shift toward local politics and coalition-building has been encouraged by Proud Boy leadership, with the apparent goal of whitewashing their reputation, avoiding the national media spotlight, and bolstering their political cachet.&#xA0;</p> <p>Prior to Jan. 6, when Proud Boys gathered in public, they were largely a chaotic, beer-swilling mass of yellow and gold itching for a fight.</p> <p>And even though violence has pretty much been an inevitability of Proud Boy appearances for years, their leaders have insisted that their public appearances are almost always carefully strategized. &#x201C;When we set out to do an event, we go, OK, what is our main objective?&#x201D; Proud Boy organizer Joe Biggs, who is currently facing conspiracy charges for his alleged actions at the Capitol, said on a podcast in December 2020. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the first thing we discuss. We take three months to plan an event.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>According to internal chats obtained by federal prosecutors, Proud Boys were under an organization-wide &#x201C;stand down&#x201D; order for three months in the immediate aftermath of the events at the Capitol. Not all chapters complied with the top-down directive, but our dataset does show that there was a relative lull in Proud Boy activity between January and March 2021&#x2014;just nine uniformed appearances in total during those three months, in four different states&#x2014;compared to the rest of the year.&#xA0;</p> <p>After that three-month hiatus, scattered Proud Boy activity began popping up around popular right-wing issues like gun rights and mask mandates&#x2014;as well as more nebulous causes, like &#x201C;freedom.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Proud Boy leader Tarrio, who is currently serving a 155-day jail sentence for vandalizing property belonging to a historically Black church in D.C., <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7edpx/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-interview\" target=\"_blank\">told VICE News</a> in September that he hoped &#x201C;the guys would focus on local elections, local candidates, and things like that.&#x201D; Tarrio, who has made several failed political bids, also discussed this strategy in one of his podcast episodes over the summer. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve been doing things on a national level for quite some time,&#x201D; said Tarrio, a Miami native. &#x201C;A lot of my guys are now focusing on their local communities. A lot of stuff with the school boards. A lot of my guys, not even just here in Florida but across the country.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Their decision to &#x201C;go local&#x201D; is in keeping with the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/extremism-us-jan-6-capitol-rcna10731\" target=\"_blank\">broader trajectory of the GOP and far-right</a>. The intense anger around the conspiracy-driven &#x201C;Stop the Steal&#x201D; movement, which culminated with thousands of Trump supporters storming the U.S. Capitol, has since bled into suburbs and towns nationwide. Typically less-than-exciting settings like school board and city council meetings have turned into ground zero for culture war issues like vaccines, mask mandates, and the supposed teaching of critical race theory, the catchall term for any socially progressive education.</p> <p>And like a culture-war edition of <i>Where&#x2019;s Waldo</i>, in the sea of disgruntled locals, QAnon moms, and rabid anti-vaxxers crowding into meeting rooms, you can often find the Proud Boys, in their gold-and-black uniforms. Here&#x2019;s some of the main takeaways from our dataset and what it says about the future of the group.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1447745412585115654\"></iframe> <h2>Geography&#xA0;</h2> <p>We found that Proud Boys last year were most active in Florida, California, and Oregon, and there was an uptick in uniformed activity in New York in the last few months of 2021.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/HeWADAGG28dHRHcKeC\"></iframe> <p>There were quite a few instances where Proud Boy activity spiked in a particular city but was short-lived as the momentum around their chosen issue faded away.&#xA0;</p> <p>In Modesto, California, Proud Boys showed up to city hall meetings in uniform on three separate occasions over a six-week period last summer to protest against police reforms and the city&#x2019;s decision to charge a white cop who fatally shot an unarmed Black man.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;The left has created this atmosphere to promote hatred for police,&#x201D; Proud Boy Sean Adam K <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZAuoHAoB0\" target=\"_blank\">said at one of those meetings&#x2014;and accused the newly established police oversight committee of being &#x201C;antifa,&#x201D; to applause from others in the room.&#xA0;</a></p> <div class=\"article__media\"><img src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1641401565046-screen-shot-2021-12-16-at-14019-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 1.40.19 PM.png\"><div class=\"article__image-caption\">Proud Boy Sean Adam K speaking at a Modesto city council meeting. </div></div> <p>Similarly, when protests against the Cuban government&#x2019;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic materialized on the streets of Miami last summer, Proud Boys saw an opportunity. Not only did they have some legitimate claim to the movement via their leader, Florida resident and Cuban-American Tarrio, but the core issues of the movement (a Communist government and harsh lockdown restrictions) fit neatly into the far-right&#x2019;s efforts to paint public health orders as fundamentally anti-American. In less than one week in July, Proud Boys made four uniformed appearances. On at least one of those nights, they showed up with a huge flag that encompassed the Proud Boy logo, with the words, &#x201C;TRUMP WON; TAKE AMERICA BACK.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/BillyCorben/status/1414982208134209540\"></iframe> <p>There were some perplexing geographical gaps in our dataset, especially in the Deep South, excluding Florida. Though Proud Boys have typically been more coastally focused (and active in areas where simmering urban-versus-rural tensions create ripe conditions for political violence), they do claim to have a presence in most states. A VICE News analysis of Proud Boy telegram channels found that the group claims to have at least 157 active chapters in the U.S., in all states apart from Delaware, Vermont, Wyoming, plus Washington, D.C. (It&#x2019;s hard to say for sure how many official Proud Boys there are in the U.S.; Tarrio has claimed there are tens of thousands of members around the world. Membership estimates by extremist group leaders should always be taken with a grain of salt. However, their national reach and ability to turn out significant numbers to large-scale events would suggest that there are at least thousands of members in the U.S.)&#xA0;</p> <p>Some of the gaps in our data could be explained by the criteria we applied to this project. Each entry had to have corresponding photo or video evidence, meaning we relied heavily on the work of local news outlets (which have been <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/who-really-behind-decline-local-news/\" target=\"_blank\">systematically gutted</a> in recent years), concerned residents, and antifascist researchers.&#xA0;</p> <p>For example, the majority of our Florida entries were sourced to Twitter posts from a group of activists working under the umbrella of Miami Against Fascism. They regularly post detailed threads mapping out connections between various far-right actors in Florida and documenting their presence at events in the Miami area.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/MIAagainstFash/status/1451035254970593281\"></iframe> <h2>Violence</h2> <p>Our other criterion was that at least one Proud Boy had to be wearing the group&#x2019;s uniform (which they refer to as &#x201C;colors&#x201D;) or insignia. This rule also resulted in a skewed perception of Proud Boy activity in 2021, especially when it comes to violent acts committed by members of the group.&#xA0;</p> <p>Different chapters have different rules about wearing colors, but often the decision to don the uniform at a particular event is made by local or national leadership, depending on its scale. Ahead of Jan. 6, Tarrio instructed members of the group to forgo colors, with the goal of blending in with the crowd in D.C.&#xA0;</p> <p>Similarly, Proud Boys from northern Illinois used Telegram<a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/8/15/22613629/proud-boys-christopher-columbus-statue-little-italy-rally-arrigo-grant-park-antifa-lori-lightfoot\" target=\"_blank\"> to plan their presence at an &#x201C;Italian Unity Day</a>&#x201D; rally in Chicago last August to demand the reinstatement of a Christopher Columbus statue. &#x201C;Hope to see you out there, Proud of your Boy&#x2014;we Need Soldiers,&#x201D; wrote one Proud Boy on the channel. &#x201C;No Colors.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;When they&#x2019;re in the field getting into something and they don&#x2019;t want Proud Boys pegged, they don&#x2019;t wear colors,&#x201D; said antifascist researcher Jenkins. &#x201C;If they don&#x2019;t want to incriminate the club, as they put it, they&#x2019;re not gonna wear their colors.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Los Angeles and its surrounding suburbs emerged as a hotspot for this type of political violence in the last year. Repeated clashes over a handful of culture war issues resulted in <a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/1-stabbed-at-los-angeles-city-hall-protest-lapd/\" target=\"_blank\">stabbings</a> and beatings in broad daylight. Researchers have identified some of the repeated perpetrators in those clashes as known Proud Boys. However, those individuals have tended to show up in LA with their faces entirely covered, without any Proud Boy insignia.</p> <p>Still, at least a fifth of the events in our dataset did involve violence, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.&#xA0;</p> <p>One particularly chaotic showdown, between Proud Boys and antifascists in Oregon City in June, was described by reporters who were there as &#x201C;open warfare&#x201D; and &#x201C;medieval clashes.&#x201D;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/PDXzane/status/1406020158838099974\"></iframe> <p>An even bloodier confrontation took place in Portland two months later, where hundreds of Proud Boys and their allies descended on the famously liberal city and battled local leftists for hours. Many who were involved in those clashes traveled over state lines to Olympia, Washington, a few weeks later, which resulted in assaults, and ultimately, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzezv/proud-boy-tiny-toese-shot-while-chasing-antifascists-as-olympia-fears-more-violence\" target=\"_blank\">an antifascist opening fire</a> on a well-known Proud Boy.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1429581695955574791\"></iframe> <h2>&#x201C;Good Neighbors&#x201D;</h2> <p>Many of the Proud Boys&#x2019; in-uniform activities fell under old-fashioned PR exercises. In addition to the E<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1376122364375760897?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">aster egg hunt</a> in a Chicago suburb (which descended into violence when they encountered counterprotesters), a chapter of Proud Boys in Montana were asked to withdraw <a href=\"https://helenair.com/news/local/proud-boys-poker-run-to-benefit-veterans-canceled/article_12eebb7e-6b61-51ca-aa9b-678511144e3d.html\" target=\"_blank\">as sponsors of a veterans poker night</a> once word got out about their planned involvement. Similarly, a Proud Boy chapter in South Dakota, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gmqy/proud-boys-say-they-cant-safely-dance-even-though-they-wanted-to\" target=\"_blank\">citing unspecific &#x201C;safety concerns</a>,&#x201D; withdrew as the sponsors of a 12-hour music festival in a small town called Scotland.&#xA0;</p> <p>Last month in Long Island, New York, a group of Proud Boys in a yellow pickup truck delivered Christmas presents to a children&apos;s hospital. A man dressed as Santa Claus rode atop the truck&#x2014;with a Proud Boy logo sewn onto his red hat.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/ScooterCasterNY/status/1473387552413728768\"></iframe> <p>Proud Boys also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAagainstFash/status/1468611419629309957?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">participated in a toy drive</a> in Miami last month to benefit the Joe DiMaggio Children&#x2019;s Hospital, and threw up the white-power &#x201C;OK&#x201D; sign while posing for a photo with a woman in a red hat saying &#x201C;We the People&#x201D; and a man in a Santa suit.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Public Comment Sessions Run Wild</h2> <p>About a quarter of the uniformed Proud Boy appearances in 2021 that we logged were at school board meetings or city council meetings.&#xA0;</p> <p>In mid-December, a group of Proud Boys with their faces covered showed up to a city council meeting in Woodbridge, a township in New Jersey often considered a bedroom suburb of New York City. Woodbridge leans Democratic but also has a large population (41%) who voted for Trump.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a racist town, really, but you do have some smatterings of people who wish it was &#x2014;and they have a loud voice,&#x201D; said Jenkins, who&#x2019;s based in Philadelphia and is especially familiar with far-right groups active in Pennsylvania and neighboring New Jersey.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/IdavoxOPP/status/1470921201035980803\"></iframe> <p>During the meeting&#x2019;s public comment session, Proud Boys verbally sparred with local activists who identified themselves as being affiliated with Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Some locals chastised the board and mayor for allowing the Proud Boys to be there in the first place. One woman spoke directly to the Proud Boys, calling them &#x201C;disgusting.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>One man who had come to the meeting with a yellow folder full of paperwork to discuss a zoning and redevelopment issue in the township also felt compelled to weigh in on the evening&#x2019;s drama&#x2014;striking a surprisingly sympathetic chord with the uniformed Proud Boy guests in their presence.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;By the way, I just wanna say something in response to all this commotion tonight,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People talk about the far-right and all that, you know, Black Lives Matter? Yeah, all lives matter, not just yours. You got your opinion, this is America, you don&#x2019;t have the right to everybody&apos;s opinion.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>A Proud Boy who gave his name as &#x201C;Burt&#x201D; said he was there to say &#x201C;we will not have our children fed sexual degeneracy or rewriting of history.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>School board meetings in Washougal, Washington, located about 20 minutes outside of Portland, have also become the backdrop to tense confrontations between uniformed Proud Boys, their allies, and parents who have kids attending the schools. Wendi Moose, a concerned parent who teaches in another district, shared photos and videos of uniformed Proud Boys at at least two meetings over the fall.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIVbbu_5TAg\"></iframe> <p>In one of those meetings, a uniformed Proud Boy addressed the other men in the room. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a father, a husband, a combat veteran&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m also part of the greatest brotherhood in the world,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;All you men have been put on notice that you are cowards. You have the power to stand up and end the CRT [Critical Race Theory], end the sex ed, get rid of the masks, quit all this bullshit.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <h2>All the allies&#xA0;</h2> <p>We also tried to keep track of the groups or individuals who showed up at the same events, and found that their peers ran the gamut from brazen white nationalists to militia types to antivax moms to aspiring politicians or even local officials. For example, Proud Boys provided security at an event in Salem, Oregon, that featured speeches by a local gun and tactical gear store, as well as the &#x201C;Stolen Voices Foundation,&#x201D; which advocates against abortion. <a href=\"https://www.app.com/story/news/local/southern-ocean-county/stafford/2021/05/11/stafford-school-nurse-rebel-against-new-jerseys-face-mask-mandate/5033830001/\" target=\"_blank\">Uniformed Proud Boys rallied</a> in support of a school nurse in New Jersey whose employment wasn&#x2019;t renewed after she refused to enforce a mask requirement. Wellness influencer and anti-vaxxer Stephanie Locricchio was among the speakers at that rally.&#xA0;</p> <p>Proud Boys also joined a protest outside a hospital in Meridian, Idaho, alongside <a href=\"https://redoubtafa.noblogs.org/post/2021/09/20/boises-proud-boy-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">members of Peoples Rights</a>, a network of anti-government activists led by Ammon Bundy. In Sacramento, California, uniformed Proud Boys <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Borwin10/status/1432088443052568577?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">provided security</a> at an antivax rally where city Supervisor Sue Frost participated.&#xA0;</p> <p>At least one uniformed Proud Boy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getsthegoods/status/1446829118218280961?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">attended a rally </a>against the removal of Confederate monuments in Palatka, Florida, held by a right-wing activist who is running in the 2022 primary against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Other attendees included a local pastor who was later arrested for his role in Jan. 6, and members of the League of the South, a violent neo-Confederate group.&#xA0;</p> <p>They&#x2019;ve also made a friend in Jo Rae Perkins, a QAnon conspiracist who&#x2019;s running for Senate out of Oregon. At a February rally in Salem that was attended by uniformed Proud Boys, Perkins took the stage and publicly thanked members of the group.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;For those of you who don&apos;t know the Proud Boys, they&#x2019;re a great group of men,&#x201D; Perkins said. &#x201C;They love this country and they love this state. They are there to make sure we don&apos;t lose our rights.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1365804944092131331\"></iframe> <p>And in Sanford, Florida, Tarrio and members of the Proud Boys held a rally outside the federal jail there to demand justice for Jan. 6 defendants, including Florida organizer Joe Biggs (who is being detained pending the outcome of his conspiracy trial). A bunch of &#x201C;White Lives Matter&#x201D; activists joined the fray.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/getsthegoods/status/1429135116773773312\"></iframe> <h2>Where do they go now?</h2> <p>The Proud Boys were founded in 2016, in the shadow of Trump&#x2019;s ascent to the White House. They almost immediately gained a reputation for hipster racism, misogyny, and brutality, especially in political-violence hotspots like Portland, Oregon. When they occasionally appeared in uniform at MAGA rallies, their presence would receive<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/19/far-right-proud-boys-chairman-sat-behind-trump-his-latest-speech/\" target=\"_blank\"> heavy scrutiny</a>. <i>(Disclosure: Gavin McInnes was a co-founder of VICE in the mid-1990s. He left the company in 2008 and has had no involvement since then. He founded the Proud Boys in 2016.)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</i></p> <p>Since then, they&#x2019;ve engaged in bloody brawls at protests and rallies around the country. Despite the mounting pile of evidence, and their own rhetoric, proving them to be a group that prides itself on violence, they&#x2019;ve continued to build credibility on the political fringes and in right-wing activist circles. They got a massive boost of legitimacy when, during a presidential debate in 2020, Trump appeared to address the Proud Boys directly, telling them to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dzxv8/trump-refused-to-condemn-white-supremacists-and-said-stand-by-for-the-proud-boys\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;stand back and stand by.</a>&#x201D; Though Trump later tried to walk back his comments, many saw them as a tacit endorsement of the Proud Boys&#x2019; actions&#x2014;past and future.&#xA0;</p> <p>When thousands of angry Trump supporters took to the streets of Washington, D.C., for two large protests in November and December that year, the Proud Boys were there too, moving around the city like a small army as people in MAGA hats <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdxze/the-million-maga-march-in-dc-got-ugly\" target=\"_blank\">cheered for them</a>, shouting things like &#x201C;We love you, Proud Boys!&#x201D; When night came, there was bloodshed, and Proud Boys were documented brawling with counterprotesters and police, and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avgvd/the-black-church-that-could-bankrupt-the-proud-boys\" target=\"_blank\">vandalizing historically Black churches.&#xA0;</a></p> <p>None of that seemed to harm their reputation among the MAGA crowd when Jan. 6 rolled around. The violence at the Capitol that day only helped further establish the Proud Boys as a household name. Dozens of members have since been charged&#x2014;and some leaders are facing serious conspiracy charges and years in prison.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p> <p>The idea that they&#x2019;ve focused their energies on establishing alliances and legitimacy in right-wing activist circles and themselves as the militant wing of the GOP should be cause for concern, especially in a tense election year where the country is as polarized as it was a year ago.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;Heading into 2022, and as we get closer to the election, we anticipate seeing the Proud Boys return to the street violence that they&#x2019;re so well known for,&#x201D; said Burghart. &#x201C;Whether it&#x2019;s engaging in the street brawls they&apos;re known for, or engaging in more attempts to harass and intimidate voters.&#x201D;</p>" "https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3n338/what-the-proud-boys-did-after-jan-6" (25045 53322) new 10 nil nil ((title nil "The Proud Boys Changed Tactics After Jan. 6.

It seemed that they were flying under the national radar, and eschewing large-scale, high-profile appearances in favor of quietly solidifying alliances around hot-button political issues and community activism.&#xA0;</p> <p>We spent the last year closely tracking and documenting this trend, and found that Proud Boys made at least 114 uniformed appearances across 73 cities in 24 states between Jan. 6 and Dec. 21, 2021.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;Over the past year, the Proud Boys have worked to embed themselves amongst local activists who haven&#x2019;t been tarnished by the Jan. 6 insurrection,&#x201D; said Devin Burghart, executive director of the Missouri-based Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights (IREHR)<b>. </b>&#x201C;They&#x2019;ve enmeshed themselves into local efforts to push back against vaccine mandates, or critical race theory, and other local conflicts, which has allowed them to steer clear of the national discussion about the insurrection and provide them with a base of support that they didn&#x2019;t have prior to Jan. 6.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <div class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\" data-children-count=\"0\"><iframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/z3n3m8/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>For example, they organized an Easter egg hunt in a Chicago suburb, serenaded a crowd of anti-vaxxers outside California&#x2019;s Capitol in Sacramento with a nationalist ballad, and posed a menacing presence at school board meetings where &#x201C;critical race theory&#x201D; was being discussed. They&#x2019;ve put together Christmas toy drives for terminally ill children in places like Seattle, Long Island, and Miami. They&#x2019;ve provided security for the &#x201C;Church at Planned Parenthood,&#x201D; led by an evangelical anti-abortion pastor, in Salem, Oregon.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;We have the Proud Boys across the street,&#x201D; said Pastor Ken Peters in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RWParlerWatch/status/1415189647127285760?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">a livestream</a> from the Salem event in July, turning the camera to a group of men in the group&#x2019;s uniform. &#x201C;Oh my goodness, thank God for the Proud Boys.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re out to make the case for the Proud Boys, show that they&#x2019;re not bad people, that they&#x2019;re here to help the community,&#x201D; said Daryle Lamont Jenkins, an antifascist researcher who has tracked the far-right for decades and runs <a href=\"https://onepeoplesproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">One People&#x2019;s Project,</a> which monitors hate groups. <b>&#x201C;</b>They&#x2019;re on some sort of publicity tour. It&apos;s pretty much them trying to sell themselves to the American people.&#x201D;</p> <p>Their PR drive might be paying off. VICE News found scant evidence that Proud Boys encountered any pushback from fellow right-wingers when they showed up to their 2021 events in uniform. Burghart sees the lack of pushback as consistent with a recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute that&#xA0; found that<a href=\"https://www.prri.org/research/competing-visions-of-america-an-evolving-identity-or-a-culture-under-attack/\" target=\"_blank\"> 68% of Republicans</a> believe the baseless conspiracy theory that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;In many camps, the Proud Boys are viewed as the militant wing defending that position,&#x201D; said Burghart. &#x201C;That they, along with the Oath Keepers and other groups, were willing to step forward and fight.&#x201D; The same survey found that 30% of Republicans (and one in five Americans) agreed that &#x201C;true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/jnewsgabe/status/1332810014835105792\"></iframe> <h2>Strategy</h2> <p>VICE News&#x2019; dataset offers key insight into ground-level Proud Boy activity in 2021&#x2014;and a better understanding of their goals headed into a crucial midterm-election year. Burghart says the Proud Boys are a bellwether for the direction and focus of the far-right more broadly.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;The important thing to remember about the Proud Boys is that they&#x2019;ve always been remarkably opportunistic,&#x201D; said Burghart. &#x201C;If you want to know where the momentum is on the far-right, watch where the Proud Boys are going.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>The Proud Boys&#x2019; shift toward local politics and coalition-building has been encouraged by Proud Boy leadership, with the apparent goal of whitewashing their reputation, avoiding the national media spotlight, and bolstering their political cachet.&#xA0;</p> <p>Prior to Jan. 6, when Proud Boys gathered in public, they were largely a chaotic, beer-swilling mass of yellow and gold itching for a fight.</p> <p>And even though violence has pretty much been an inevitability of Proud Boy appearances for years, their leaders have insisted that their public appearances are almost always carefully strategized. &#x201C;When we set out to do an event, we go, OK, what is our main objective?&#x201D; Proud Boy organizer Joe Biggs, who is currently facing conspiracy charges for his alleged actions at the Capitol, said on a podcast in December 2020. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the first thing we discuss. We take three months to plan an event.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>According to internal chats obtained by federal prosecutors, Proud Boys were under an organization-wide &#x201C;stand down&#x201D; order for three months in the immediate aftermath of the events at the Capitol. Not all chapters complied with the top-down directive, but our dataset does show that there was a relative lull in Proud Boy activity between January and March 2021&#x2014;just nine uniformed appearances in total during those three months, in four different states&#x2014;compared to the rest of the year.&#xA0;</p> <p>After that three-month hiatus, scattered Proud Boy activity began popping up around popular right-wing issues like gun rights and mask mandates&#x2014;as well as more nebulous causes, like &#x201C;freedom.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Proud Boy leader Tarrio, who is currently serving a 155-day jail sentence for vandalizing property belonging to a historically Black church in D.C., <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7edpx/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-interview\" target=\"_blank\">told VICE News</a> in September that he hoped &#x201C;the guys would focus on local elections, local candidates, and things like that.&#x201D; Tarrio, who has made several failed political bids, also discussed this strategy in one of his podcast episodes over the summer. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve been doing things on a national level for quite some time,&#x201D; said Tarrio, a Miami native. &#x201C;A lot of my guys are now focusing on their local communities. A lot of stuff with the school boards. A lot of my guys, not even just here in Florida but across the country.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Their decision to &#x201C;go local&#x201D; is in keeping with the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/extremism-us-jan-6-capitol-rcna10731\" target=\"_blank\">broader trajectory of the GOP and far-right</a>. The intense anger around the conspiracy-driven &#x201C;Stop the Steal&#x201D; movement, which culminated with thousands of Trump supporters storming the U.S. Capitol, has since bled into suburbs and towns nationwide. Typically less-than-exciting settings like school board and city council meetings have turned into ground zero for culture war issues like vaccines, mask mandates, and the supposed teaching of critical race theory, the catchall term for any socially progressive education.</p> <p>And like a culture-war edition of <i>Where&#x2019;s Waldo</i>, in the sea of disgruntled locals, QAnon moms, and rabid anti-vaxxers crowding into meeting rooms, you can often find the Proud Boys, in their gold-and-black uniforms. Here&#x2019;s some of the main takeaways from our dataset and what it says about the future of the group.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1447745412585115654\"></iframe> <h2>Geography&#xA0;</h2> <p>We found that Proud Boys last year were most active in Florida, California, and Oregon, and there was an uptick in uniformed activity in New York in the last few months of 2021.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/HeWADAGG28dHRHcKeC\"></iframe> <p>There were quite a few instances where Proud Boy activity spiked in a particular city but was short-lived as the momentum around their chosen issue faded away.&#xA0;</p> <p>In Modesto, California, Proud Boys showed up to city hall meetings in uniform on three separate occasions over a six-week period last summer to protest against police reforms and the city&#x2019;s decision to charge a white cop who fatally shot an unarmed Black man.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;The left has created this atmosphere to promote hatred for police,&#x201D; Proud Boy Sean Adam K <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZAuoHAoB0\" target=\"_blank\">said at one of those meetings&#x2014;and accused the newly established police oversight committee of being &#x201C;antifa,&#x201D; to applause from others in the room.&#xA0;</a></p> <div class=\"article__media\"><img src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1641401565046-screen-shot-2021-12-16-at-14019-pm.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 1.40.19 PM.png\"><div class=\"article__image-caption\">Proud Boy Sean Adam K speaking at a Modesto city council meeting. </div></div> <p>Similarly, when protests against the Cuban government&#x2019;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic materialized on the streets of Miami last summer, Proud Boys saw an opportunity. Not only did they have some legitimate claim to the movement via their leader, Florida resident and Cuban-American Tarrio, but the core issues of the movement (a Communist government and harsh lockdown restrictions) fit neatly into the far-right&#x2019;s efforts to paint public health orders as fundamentally anti-American. In less than one week in July, Proud Boys made four uniformed appearances. On at least one of those nights, they showed up with a huge flag that encompassed the Proud Boy logo, with the words, &#x201C;TRUMP WON; TAKE AMERICA BACK.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/BillyCorben/status/1414982208134209540\"></iframe> <p>There were some perplexing geographical gaps in our dataset, especially in the Deep South, excluding Florida. Though Proud Boys have typically been more coastally focused (and active in areas where simmering urban-versus-rural tensions create ripe conditions for political violence), they do claim to have a presence in most states. A VICE News analysis of Proud Boy telegram channels found that the group claims to have at least 157 active chapters in the U.S., in all states apart from Delaware, Vermont, Wyoming, plus Washington, D.C. (It&#x2019;s hard to say for sure how many official Proud Boys there are in the U.S.; Tarrio has claimed there are tens of thousands of members around the world. Membership estimates by extremist group leaders should always be taken with a grain of salt. However, their national reach and ability to turn out significant numbers to large-scale events would suggest that there are at least thousands of members in the U.S.)&#xA0;</p> <p>Some of the gaps in our data could be explained by the criteria we applied to this project. Each entry had to have corresponding photo or video evidence, meaning we relied heavily on the work of local news outlets (which have been <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/who-really-behind-decline-local-news/\" target=\"_blank\">systematically gutted</a> in recent years), concerned residents, and antifascist researchers.&#xA0;</p> <p>For example, the majority of our Florida entries were sourced to Twitter posts from a group of activists working under the umbrella of Miami Against Fascism. They regularly post detailed threads mapping out connections between various far-right actors in Florida and documenting their presence at events in the Miami area.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/MIAagainstFash/status/1451035254970593281\"></iframe> <h2>Violence</h2> <p>Our other criterion was that at least one Proud Boy had to be wearing the group&#x2019;s uniform (which they refer to as &#x201C;colors&#x201D;) or insignia. This rule also resulted in a skewed perception of Proud Boy activity in 2021, especially when it comes to violent acts committed by members of the group.&#xA0;</p> <p>Different chapters have different rules about wearing colors, but often the decision to don the uniform at a particular event is made by local or national leadership, depending on its scale. Ahead of Jan. 6, Tarrio instructed members of the group to forgo colors, with the goal of blending in with the crowd in D.C.&#xA0;</p> <p>Similarly, Proud Boys from northern Illinois used Telegram<a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/8/15/22613629/proud-boys-christopher-columbus-statue-little-italy-rally-arrigo-grant-park-antifa-lori-lightfoot\" target=\"_blank\"> to plan their presence at an &#x201C;Italian Unity Day</a>&#x201D; rally in Chicago last August to demand the reinstatement of a Christopher Columbus statue. &#x201C;Hope to see you out there, Proud of your Boy&#x2014;we Need Soldiers,&#x201D; wrote one Proud Boy on the channel. &#x201C;No Colors.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;When they&#x2019;re in the field getting into something and they don&#x2019;t want Proud Boys pegged, they don&#x2019;t wear colors,&#x201D; said antifascist researcher Jenkins. &#x201C;If they don&#x2019;t want to incriminate the club, as they put it, they&#x2019;re not gonna wear their colors.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Los Angeles and its surrounding suburbs emerged as a hotspot for this type of political violence in the last year. Repeated clashes over a handful of culture war issues resulted in <a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/1-stabbed-at-los-angeles-city-hall-protest-lapd/\" target=\"_blank\">stabbings</a> and beatings in broad daylight. Researchers have identified some of the repeated perpetrators in those clashes as known Proud Boys. However, those individuals have tended to show up in LA with their faces entirely covered, without any Proud Boy insignia.</p> <p>Still, at least a fifth of the events in our dataset did involve violence, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.&#xA0;</p> <p>One particularly chaotic showdown, between Proud Boys and antifascists in Oregon City in June, was described by reporters who were there as &#x201C;open warfare&#x201D; and &#x201C;medieval clashes.&#x201D;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/PDXzane/status/1406020158838099974\"></iframe> <p>An even bloodier confrontation took place in Portland two months later, where hundreds of Proud Boys and their allies descended on the famously liberal city and battled local leftists for hours. Many who were involved in those clashes traveled over state lines to Olympia, Washington, a few weeks later, which resulted in assaults, and ultimately, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzezv/proud-boy-tiny-toese-shot-while-chasing-antifascists-as-olympia-fears-more-violence\" target=\"_blank\">an antifascist opening fire</a> on a well-known Proud Boy.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1429581695955574791\"></iframe> <h2>&#x201C;Good Neighbors&#x201D;</h2> <p>Many of the Proud Boys&#x2019; in-uniform activities fell under old-fashioned PR exercises. In addition to the E<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1376122364375760897?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">aster egg hunt</a> in a Chicago suburb (which descended into violence when they encountered counterprotesters), a chapter of Proud Boys in Montana were asked to withdraw <a href=\"https://helenair.com/news/local/proud-boys-poker-run-to-benefit-veterans-canceled/article_12eebb7e-6b61-51ca-aa9b-678511144e3d.html\" target=\"_blank\">as sponsors of a veterans poker night</a> once word got out about their planned involvement. Similarly, a Proud Boy chapter in South Dakota, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gmqy/proud-boys-say-they-cant-safely-dance-even-though-they-wanted-to\" target=\"_blank\">citing unspecific &#x201C;safety concerns</a>,&#x201D; withdrew as the sponsors of a 12-hour music festival in a small town called Scotland.&#xA0;</p> <p>Last month in Long Island, New York, a group of Proud Boys in a yellow pickup truck delivered Christmas presents to a children&apos;s hospital. A man dressed as Santa Claus rode atop the truck&#x2014;with a Proud Boy logo sewn onto his red hat.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/ScooterCasterNY/status/1473387552413728768\"></iframe> <p>Proud Boys also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAagainstFash/status/1468611419629309957?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">participated in a toy drive</a> in Miami last month to benefit the Joe DiMaggio Children&#x2019;s Hospital, and threw up the white-power &#x201C;OK&#x201D; sign while posing for a photo with a woman in a red hat saying &#x201C;We the People&#x201D; and a man in a Santa suit.&#xA0;</p> <h2>Public Comment Sessions Run Wild</h2> <p>About a quarter of the uniformed Proud Boy appearances in 2021 that we logged were at school board meetings or city council meetings.&#xA0;</p> <p>In mid-December, a group of Proud Boys with their faces covered showed up to a city council meeting in Woodbridge, a township in New Jersey often considered a bedroom suburb of New York City. Woodbridge leans Democratic but also has a large population (41%) who voted for Trump.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a racist town, really, but you do have some smatterings of people who wish it was &#x2014;and they have a loud voice,&#x201D; said Jenkins, who&#x2019;s based in Philadelphia and is especially familiar with far-right groups active in Pennsylvania and neighboring New Jersey.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/IdavoxOPP/status/1470921201035980803\"></iframe> <p>During the meeting&#x2019;s public comment session, Proud Boys verbally sparred with local activists who identified themselves as being affiliated with Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Some locals chastised the board and mayor for allowing the Proud Boys to be there in the first place. One woman spoke directly to the Proud Boys, calling them &#x201C;disgusting.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>One man who had come to the meeting with a yellow folder full of paperwork to discuss a zoning and redevelopment issue in the township also felt compelled to weigh in on the evening&#x2019;s drama&#x2014;striking a surprisingly sympathetic chord with the uniformed Proud Boy guests in their presence.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;By the way, I just wanna say something in response to all this commotion tonight,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People talk about the far-right and all that, you know, Black Lives Matter? Yeah, all lives matter, not just yours. You got your opinion, this is America, you don&#x2019;t have the right to everybody&apos;s opinion.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>A Proud Boy who gave his name as &#x201C;Burt&#x201D; said he was there to say &#x201C;we will not have our children fed sexual degeneracy or rewriting of history.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>School board meetings in Washougal, Washington, located about 20 minutes outside of Portland, have also become the backdrop to tense confrontations between uniformed Proud Boys, their allies, and parents who have kids attending the schools. Wendi Moose, a concerned parent who teaches in another district, shared photos and videos of uniformed Proud Boys at at least two meetings over the fall.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIVbbu_5TAg\"></iframe> <p>In one of those meetings, a uniformed Proud Boy addressed the other men in the room. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a father, a husband, a combat veteran&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m also part of the greatest brotherhood in the world,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;All you men have been put on notice that you are cowards. You have the power to stand up and end the CRT [Critical Race Theory], end the sex ed, get rid of the masks, quit all this bullshit.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <h2>All the allies&#xA0;</h2> <p>We also tried to keep track of the groups or individuals who showed up at the same events, and found that their peers ran the gamut from brazen white nationalists to militia types to antivax moms to aspiring politicians or even local officials. For example, Proud Boys provided security at an event in Salem, Oregon, that featured speeches by a local gun and tactical gear store, as well as the &#x201C;Stolen Voices Foundation,&#x201D; which advocates against abortion. <a href=\"https://www.app.com/story/news/local/southern-ocean-county/stafford/2021/05/11/stafford-school-nurse-rebel-against-new-jerseys-face-mask-mandate/5033830001/\" target=\"_blank\">Uniformed Proud Boys rallied</a> in support of a school nurse in New Jersey whose employment wasn&#x2019;t renewed after she refused to enforce a mask requirement. Wellness influencer and anti-vaxxer Stephanie Locricchio was among the speakers at that rally.&#xA0;</p> <p>Proud Boys also joined a protest outside a hospital in Meridian, Idaho, alongside <a href=\"https://redoubtafa.noblogs.org/post/2021/09/20/boises-proud-boy-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">members of Peoples Rights</a>, a network of anti-government activists led by Ammon Bundy. In Sacramento, California, uniformed Proud Boys <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Borwin10/status/1432088443052568577?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">provided security</a> at an antivax rally where city Supervisor Sue Frost participated.&#xA0;</p> <p>At least one uniformed Proud Boy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getsthegoods/status/1446829118218280961?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">attended a rally </a>against the removal of Confederate monuments in Palatka, Florida, held by a right-wing activist who is running in the 2022 primary against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Other attendees included a local pastor who was later arrested for his role in Jan. 6, and members of the League of the South, a violent neo-Confederate group.&#xA0;</p> <p>They&#x2019;ve also made a friend in Jo Rae Perkins, a QAnon conspiracist who&#x2019;s running for Senate out of Oregon. At a February rally in Salem that was attended by uniformed Proud Boys, Perkins took the stage and publicly thanked members of the group.&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C;For those of you who don&apos;t know the Proud Boys, they&#x2019;re a great group of men,&#x201D; Perkins said. &#x201C;They love this country and they love this state. They are there to make sure we don&apos;t lose our rights.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1365804944092131331\"></iframe> <p>And in Sanford, Florida, Tarrio and members of the Proud Boys held a rally outside the federal jail there to demand justice for Jan. 6 defendants, including Florida organizer Joe Biggs (who is being detained pending the outcome of his conspiracy trial). A bunch of &#x201C;White Lives Matter&#x201D; activists joined the fray.&#xA0;</p> <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitter.com/getsthegoods/status/1429135116773773312\"></iframe> <h2>Where do they go now?</h2> <p>The Proud Boys were founded in 2016, in the shadow of Trump&#x2019;s ascent to the White House. They almost immediately gained a reputation for hipster racism, misogyny, and brutality, especially in political-violence hotspots like Portland, Oregon. When they occasionally appeared in uniform at MAGA rallies, their presence would receive<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/19/far-right-proud-boys-chairman-sat-behind-trump-his-latest-speech/\" target=\"_blank\"> heavy scrutiny</a>. <i>(Disclosure: Gavin McInnes was a co-founder of VICE in the mid-1990s. He left the company in 2008 and has had no involvement since then. He founded the Proud Boys in 2016.)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</i></p> <p>Since then, they&#x2019;ve engaged in bloody brawls at protests and rallies around the country. Despite the mounting pile of evidence, and their own rhetoric, proving them to be a group that prides itself on violence, they&#x2019;ve continued to build credibility on the political fringes and in right-wing activist circles. They got a massive boost of legitimacy when, during a presidential debate in 2020, Trump appeared to address the Proud Boys directly, telling them to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dzxv8/trump-refused-to-condemn-white-supremacists-and-said-stand-by-for-the-proud-boys\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;stand back and stand by.</a>&#x201D; Though Trump later tried to walk back his comments, many saw them as a tacit endorsement of the Proud Boys&#x2019; actions&#x2014;past and future.&#xA0;</p> <p>When thousands of angry Trump supporters took to the streets of Washington, D.C., for two large protests in November and December that year, the Proud Boys were there too, moving around the city like a small army as people in MAGA hats <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdxze/the-million-maga-march-in-dc-got-ugly\" target=\"_blank\">cheered for them</a>, shouting things like &#x201C;We love you, Proud Boys!&#x201D; When night came, there was bloodshed, and Proud Boys were documented brawling with counterprotesters and police, and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avgvd/the-black-church-that-could-bankrupt-the-proud-boys\" target=\"_blank\">vandalizing historically Black churches.&#xA0;</a></p> <p>None of that seemed to harm their reputation among the MAGA crowd when Jan. 6 rolled around. The violence at the Capitol that day only helped further establish the Proud Boys as a household name.
